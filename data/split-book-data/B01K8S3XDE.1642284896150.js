window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The nail-biting continuation of the Lightbringer series from <i>New York Times</i> best seller Brent Weeks.&nbsp;</p> <p>When does an empire fall?&nbsp;</p> <p>The Seven Satrapies have collapsed into four - and those are falling before the White King's armies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gavin Guile, ex-emperor, ex-Prism, ex-galley slave, formerly the one man who might have averted war, is now lost, broken, and trapped in a prison crafted by his own hands to hold a great magical genius. But Gavin has no magic at all. Worse, in this prison Gavin may not be alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kip Guile will make a last desperate attempt to stop the White King's growing horde. Karris White attempts to knit together an empire falling apart, helped only by her murderous and possibly treasonous father-in-law, Andross Guile.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile Teia's new talents will find a darker use - and the cost might be too much to bear. Together they will fight to prevent a tainted empire from becoming something even worse.&nbsp;</p>";
