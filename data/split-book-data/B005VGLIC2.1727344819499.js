window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A masterpiece of historical fiction, this is the Great Novel of America's \"Greatest Generation\". </p> <p>Herman Wouk's sweeping epic of World War II, which begins with <i>The Winds of War</i> and continues in <i>War and Remembrance,</i> stands as the crowning achievement of one of America's most celebrated storytellers. Like no other books about the war, Wouk's spellbinding narrative captures the tide of global events - and all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of World War II - as it immerses us in the lives of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom.</p>";
