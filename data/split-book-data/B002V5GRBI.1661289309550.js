window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this live lecture, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explores intention as an all-pervading force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. Intention, he explains, is not something you do, but an energy you're a part of. Not only do you emanate from the field of intention, but if you align yourself to it, your desires become fulfilled and you find yourself at peace. </p> <p>Healing, manifesting your desires, and creating miracles are genuine possibilities, and indeed, probabilities, when you listen to Dr. Dyer and connect to the power of intention.</p>";
