The greatest danger of all lies to the west, where the First Prince of Procer restored order at last: her people sundered, she ponders if a crusade might not be the way to secure her reign.</p> <p>Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of the conquered lands, the most dangerous man alive sat across an orphan girl and offered her a knife.</p> <p>Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan.</p>";
