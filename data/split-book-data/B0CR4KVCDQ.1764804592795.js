And right now, things are pretty freaking great for Victor.</p> <p>After causing the usual amount of mayhem elsewhere, he and his warrior-maiden ally, Valla, have finally taken a portal back to Fanwath—loaded up with more powers and treasure than they know what to do with. But stumbling upon Fainhallow, a school for studying the art of magic, Victor uncovers a revelation that shakes him to his very core.</p> <p>And such personal chaos couldn't come at a worse time. Because the advances Victor has made are pushing him to the brink of losing all control, awakening hidden aspects of his spirit and threatening to transform him into something very dark and very, very deadly. But then again, on Fanwath the deadlier you are now, the more alive you're bound to be later....</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
