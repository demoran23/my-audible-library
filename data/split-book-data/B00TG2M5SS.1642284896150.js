window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Forbidden Library</i> kicks off a brand new classic fantasy series perfect for fans of <i>Coraline</i>, <i>Ink heart</i>, and <i>The Books of Elsewhere</i></b>. </p> <p><i>Alice always thought fairy tales had happy endings. That - along with everything else - changed the day she met her first fairy.</i> </p> <p>When Alice's father goes down in a shipwreck, she is sent to live with her uncle Geryon - an uncle she's never heard of and knows nothing about. He lives in an enormous manor with a massive library that is off-limits to Alice. But then she meets a talking cat. And even for a rule-follower, when a talking cat sneaks you into a forbidden library and introduces you to an arrogant boy who dares you to open a book, it's hard to resist. Especially if you're a reader to begin with. Soon Alice finds herself INSIDE the book, and the only way out is to defeat the creature imprisoned within. </p> <p>It seems her uncle is more than he says he is. But then so is Alice.</p>";
