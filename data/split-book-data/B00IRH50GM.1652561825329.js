window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is a tale of ghosts, of madness, of revenge - of old alliances giving way to new intrigues. Denmark is changing, shaking off its medieval past. War with Norway is on the horizon. And Hamlet - son of the old king, nephew of the new - becomes increasingly entangled in a web of deception - and murder. </p> <p>Struggling to find his place in this strange new order Hamlet tries to rekindle his relationship with Ophelia - the daughter of Elsinore’s cunning spy master, a man with plots of his own. Hamlet turns for advice and support to the one person he can trust -- Young Yorick, the slippery, unruly jester, whose father helped Hamlet through a difficult childhood. And all the while the armed forces of Fortinbras, prince of Norway, start to assemble, threatening to bring down Elsinore forever. </p> <p>Beautifully performed by actor Richard Armitage (\"Thorin Oakenshield\" in the Hobbit films), <i>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</i> takes Shakespeare’s original into unexpected realms, reinventing a story we thought we knew. </p> <p>A. J. Hartley is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Will Hawthorne fantasy series and several thrillers, as well as the Darwen Arkwright books for younger readers. He is the Russell Robinson Distinguished Professor of Shakespeare at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. </p> <p>David Hewson is the best-selling author of more than 20 novels, including the Nic Costa crime series and a trilogy of books based on the hit Danish television show <i>The Killing</i>. His most-recent novel, <i>The House of Dolls</i>, begins a new series set in Amsterdam.</p> <p>Richard Armitage is known to movie audiences around the world as \"Thorin Oakenshield\" in the trilogy of films based on <i>The Hobbit</i>. Born in Leicester, England, and trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Armitage has performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and created memorable roles on <i>Robin Hood</i>, <i>North &amp; South</i>, and other British TV series.</p>";
