The Grotto is safe once more, and the gnomes are finally beginning to regroup.</p> <p>But when a greater threat rises, their only hope of survival is to embark upon a monumental exodus, abandoning everything they’ve built and striking out across the surface in search of a new home. As the god of gnomes, Corey must place more faith than ever before in his denizens - and a few unexpected allies.</p> <p>Driven from their underground realm, the gnomes’ skills and resilience will be tested to their limits by deadly terrain, vicious wildlife and unseen enemies snapping at their heels. If they cannot survive the perils of the journey and reach their new base before time runs out...all will be lost.</p> <p>Inspired by the god sims such as <i>Black &amp; White</i>, dungeon managers like <i>Dungeon Keeper </i>and civ builders like<i> Age of Empires</i>, <i>Exodus of Gnomes</i> is the second in a new generation of LitRPG and Dungeon Core stories - God Core.</p>";
