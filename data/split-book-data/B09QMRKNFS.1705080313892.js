Or not exactly...</p> <p>The island prince Kale Alaku now haunts his mind, rattling within his once peaceful Grove, promising revenge and growing every moment in power. Meanwhile, the Pyu isles are in chaos; the coastal kingdom of the Tong is still Rukaâ€™s enemy; and every day that passes brings the empire closer to destroying his dream of a new world for his people.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once again, the son of Beyla will need the strength of his dark twin, Bukayag. Perhaps together they can unite three peoples, gather an army of ash, and defend or destroy their way to peace. But in the end, there can be only one king of heaven...</p>";
