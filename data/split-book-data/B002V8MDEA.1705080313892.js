window.bookSummaryJSON = "Fleeing assailants through alleyways in Denver late one night, Thomas Hunter narrowly escapes to the roof of an industrial building. Then a silent bullet from the night clips his head and his world goes black. When he awakes, he finds himself in an entirely different reality, a green forest that seems more real than where he was. Every time he tries to sleep, he wakes up in the other world, and soon he truly no longer knows which reality is real. Slowly he realizes that each reality dramatically impacts the other. In each world unspeakable evil is unleashed and millions of lives hang in the balance. The fate of two worlds depends on the actions of one man: Thomas Hunter.";
