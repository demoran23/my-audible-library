window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The illegal Monster Hunt app has definitely done a number on Chase Knowles’ life, transforming him from a down-on-his-luck musician to the Alpha of two incredible Huntresses. Along with his bandmate Iris, the group has taken New York City by storm, hunting and brawling in the city’s landmarks and hard-to-reach spaces.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there is more to the Monster Hunt app than catch or sell. An exclusive world known as EverLife presents new challenges, new adventure, and a mystery that none have been able to solve. It also presents new foes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: Monster Hunt NYC contains a light harem with monster girls, augmented reality, fantasy <i>violence</i>, a ton of action, and GameLit/LitRPG concepts. It was inspired by the <i>Persona</i> games, <i>Pokemon Go!</i>, and <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Book three is out now!&nbsp;</p>";
