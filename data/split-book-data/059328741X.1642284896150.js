I’m not joining his pack of adoring fans.</p> <p>I don’t need help surviving the Scholomance, even if they do.&nbsp;Forget the hordes of monsters and cursed artifacts, I’m probably the most dangerous thing in the place. Just give me a chance and I’ll level mountains and kill untold millions, make myself the dark queen of the world.</p> <p>At least, that’s what the world expects.&nbsp;Most of the other students in here would be delighted if Orion killed me like one more evil thing that’s crawled out of the drains.

Readers will delight in the push-and-pull of El and Orion’s relationship, the fantastically detailed world, the clever magic system, and the matter-of-fact diversity of the student body.” (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>, starred review)</b></p>";
