Empires are rising from the ashes of dead civilizations as the merged worlds of Panu come together. Most prominent is the Thane Necropolis, the inheritance of Prince Riven Thane and home to more than fifty-one million vampire citizens and six billion slaves. Here, Riven's word is law—whether he likes it or not. Lately, he's been iffy on the subject.</p> <p>The catastrophes, wars, violent uprisings, and rampant corruption in the wake of Riven's rise to power have caused him no shortage of guilt. So comes his latest directive, much to the outrage to his lineage: the enslaved of the necropolis are to be granted equal rights to the vampire citizens. It's a new quest for Riven, but it could trigger a war of its own.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an enemy, whose grudge is more personal than political is out for blood. His mission is to erase Riven from the leaderboards, and he'll stop at nothing to do it. Riven's sister, fiancée, and attendant demon are all in the crosshairs unless Riven can tap into his darkest vampiric instincts to strike first . . . and fast.</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 900,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
