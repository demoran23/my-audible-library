Timid, weak, and bullied, Wulfric is as unlikely a candidate as there could be. </p> <p>A chance encounter with an ancient and mysterious object awakens a latent gift, and Wulfric's life changes course. Against a backdrop of war, tragedy, and an enemy whose hatred for him knows no bounds, Wulfric will be forged from a young boy into the Wolf of the North. This is his tale. </p>";
