But a foolish attempt to prove his bravery leads Kai to unlock hidden power within himself and acquire a most unlikely ally.</p> <p>Rhona is a battle-scarred soldier who’s as likely to toss a quip as she is to throw a punch. After setting aside a promising career in the army to pursue the Path of the Bleeding Tiger, she sets out to stop a war and seek atonement for a bloody past.</p> <p>When Bancroft the Earth Core awakens, he can’t wait to clean up his dungeon and begin building things anew. A recovered item from his past reminds him that more is at stake, however, putting an end to such pleasantries.</p> <p>Join The Guild Core, a small band of friends determined to restore the world to an age of dragons, heroes, and honor.</p> <p>The Guild Core is a series by TJ Reynolds, fantasy LitRPG author of Eternal Online books one to three.
