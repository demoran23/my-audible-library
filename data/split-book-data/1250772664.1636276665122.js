window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Jay Kristoff comes </b><b><i>Empire of the Vampire</i></b><b>, the first volume of an astonishing new dark fantasy saga.</b></p> <p><i>From holy cup comes holy light;</i></p> <p><i>The faithful hand sets world aright.</i></p> <p><i>And in the Seven Martyrs’ sight,</i></p> <p><i>Mere man shall end this endless night.</i></p> <p>It has been 27 long years since the last sunrise. For nearly three decades, vampires have waged war against humanity; building their eternal empire even as they tear down our own. Now, only a few tiny sparks of light endure in a sea of darkness.</p> <p>Gabriel de León is a silversaint: a member of a holy brotherhood dedicated to defending realm and church from the creatures of the night. But even the Silver Order could not stem the tide once daylight failed us, and now, only Gabriel remains.</p> <p>Imprisoned by the very monsters he vowed to destroy, the last silversaint is forced to tell his story. A story of legendary battles and forbidden love, of faith lost and friendships won, of the Wars of the Blood and the Forever King and the quest for humanity’s last remaining hope: the Holy Grail.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press.</b></p> <p><b>“Brilliant and unputdownable, with tenderness and light bound into the bitterdark of a grim and fascinating world.” (Laini Taylor, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Strange the Dreamer</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Kristoff wields his writing like a fine blade - well-balanced, graceful and wickedly sharp.” (V.E. Schwab, </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of</b><b><i> The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
