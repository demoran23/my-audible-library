What will it require of him? And where does he need to go next to make it happen? When he meets Justinian Merkovah—a strangely ageless spellcaster, teacher of religious law, and nomadic exorcist—he's one step closer to discovering the answers . . .</p> <p>With his experience providing security to the rich and terrible, Truth accepts a gig as Merkovah's bodyguard. What better way for Truth to grow as a mage? And what better body to guard than one that can help rid him of the demonic System trapped inside his own?</p> <p>Truth and Merkovah are soon joined by two of the latter's enigmatic students on a journey through an ancient land where both devils <i>and</i> angels lash out with fire, fury, and Old Testament devastation. Finally, Truth sees the world, previously kept hidden by Starbrite, as it really is. And he learns that magic—<i>real</i> magic—is far more powerful and strange than he ever imagined.</p> <p>But one thing Truth has always known is that power comes at a price. And the price for Merkovah's help may be more than Truth is willing to pay. Unfortunately, he doesn't have much of a choice. Crops are failing; wars are heating up; even God has looked away in disgust. What can one slumrat hope to do in the face of all that? Except rise—and fight.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit cyberpunk fantasy series—with more than one million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
