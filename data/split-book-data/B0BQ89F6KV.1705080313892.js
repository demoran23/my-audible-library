window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Always the Dungeon Master, never the druid.</b></p> <p>Juniper Smith is finally starting to feel at home in this new world. Everywhere he looks are familiar pieces of the game worlds he used to make back on Earth.</p> <p>The last druid has died, and with her, a rare and precious magic is slowly seeping its way out of the world. The ritual to bring her back as an infant only requires a little messing around with devils and simply hacking the game system on his soul, which is practically routine, but to speed the process along will be another matter entirely.<br> Getting to the Bottomless Pit will take a long train ride where any misstep might blow the partyâ€™s cover. Going down the Pit will require a flying machine and some false pretenses. But once they're down there, the team hopes to find a living house, one of Uther Penndraig's old strongholds. Aside from the time chamber they need, Juniper is pretty sure that the world's greatest philosopher-king will have left them some surprises.</p> <p>Come inside and join the game!</p>";
