But even the mightiest fall. When he finally meets his end, he's the last vampire lord standing, killed by two heroes, whom he drags with him into death. (At least he has that.)</p> <p>But death isn't the end. Instead of eternal darkness for this soulless being, Kyler awakens in a strange world, no longer the ancient predator he once was. His new reality is a role-based leveling system in which only the strongest and rarest classes have power. And to reflect his talents, the system has assigned him a nice, rare class: <i>Vampire Lord</i> (of course).</p> <p>After a thousand years as a ruthless monster, Kyler sees an opportunity to be someone else. This time, in this new body—which just so happens to have last belonged to a murdered student at Vandal Academy—he hopes to walk a different path. What if, instead of becoming a tyrannical ruler, he avenged Kyler Evans's death at the hands of troublesome nobles . . . and maybe even became a hero along the way?</p> <p>Then again, breaking habits formed over centuries isn't easy. Old instincts die hard, and there's this pesky Spear of Dawn that seems to want Kyler dead (. . . or for him to adopt her, either way). But with a fresh start, a new self, and all the knowledge of his past life, he's ready to carve out his place in this unfamiliar existence—hopefully without dying once more.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 100,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
