He crushed every trial and escaped with two demon minions—and his life. At least, so to speak. Riven isn't so much alive as he is <i>undead</i>. Now, discovering his true self as a pureblooded vampire, he's feeling a little guilty and <i>a lot</i> hungry in this brand-new world. And what a world it is.</p> <p>Earth as Riven knew it has merged with Zazir and Elhisterii to form the post-apocalyptic creation of the Elysium known as Panu. Here, errant goblins and vulnerable elves battle it out, ungodly monsters spawn like crazy, suicide zombies run wild, and the streets are strewn with human remains.</p> <p>On a mission to find his sister, Allie—out there somewhere battling her own demons—Riven quickly learns that every time he kills his bloodlust only increases, bringing him ever closer to becoming a full-blown harbinger of doom. But maybe a vampiric hero is just what this mad new world needs.</p> <p>Riven is embracing his destiny. He can feel it. His ancient ancestors are calling him home.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 900,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
