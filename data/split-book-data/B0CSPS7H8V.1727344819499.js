window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When an alternate Earth is subsumed into a new reality comprising many worlds, a young vampire is the only one with the knowledge needed to save her planet.</b></p> <p>Sold to a vampire cartel at a young age so her starving family could eat, Marianna Rojas is accustomed to fighting for her survival. When her temper leads her to make a terrible mistake, the vampire master of the Lágrima Sangrienta Cartel decides to make an example of her. Near death, her life is spared by mere chance, but she opens her eyes in the wilderness to find two moons hanging in the sky above her.</p> <p>Earth is being subsumed into a new reality by a spell with godlike power, and Marianna has been chosen as one of thirty Exemplars to experience the new world ahead of the rest of the planet's denizens. As a vampire herself, she's used to striking fear into the hearts of all, but now it seems like every monster lurking in the shadows is out for <i>her</i> blood. She'll have to learn this new realm's rules and level up her skills—and fast.</p> <p>Accompanied by a tiny dragon named Saia, Marianna works to master the mysterious Mask, which seems to be the source of all the new skills now available to her. With it, she sets out to discover the path to fulfillment of her destiny. Suddenly flush with magic, she's more powerful than she's ever been, and the Thirst is thrumming in her veins. But she only has a month before she's sent back to the freshly integrated Earth to help with its transition.</p> <p>Determined, Marianna trains to fight, and between the Dwarves, the Elves, and the warlike YoKai-ni, she has plenty of opportunities to practice. But to what lengths will she go to survive—and save as much of the Earth she left behind as possible?</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 200,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
