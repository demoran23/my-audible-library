window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Malcontents are back in action! </p> <p><i>Into the Wild</i>, the new novel by acclaimed author Larry Correia, picks up the story begun in Correia's previous entry in the series, <i>Into the Storm</i>. </p> <p>Now under the leadership of the reluctant Lieutenant Kelvan Cleasby, the Sixth Platoon of Storm Knights has been ordered to accompany an archeological expedition from the Royal Cygnaran University deep into the Wyrmwall Mountains to investigate an ancient site of potentially great historical value. But what seems a simple enough assignment will rapidly turn into a test of the platoon's survival skills - an abandoned fort, the lone survivor of a horrifying attack, and a ferociously territorial tribe may be more than even the Malcontents can handle. </p>";
