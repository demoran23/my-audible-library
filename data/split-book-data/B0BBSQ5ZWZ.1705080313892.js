window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Do you want to avoid perishing in a hail of asteroids? Us too. That’s why we created Astra Epsilon: the perfect escape for your mind, even though your body is about to be destroyed.</b></p> <p>As the end of the world rapidly approaches—both figuratively and literally—Astra Epsilon seems to be the last hope humanity has of sidestepping that awkward thing called death.&nbsp;</p> <p>With only a few weeks to spare, two brothers and a trio of roommates arrive at the local Ascension Port, intent on unloading their minds into the game—rather than waiting idly for their inevitable doom.&nbsp;</p> <p>The two groups find themselves joined together by random chance to make the obligate team of five. They Ascend, leaving their Earthly bodies behind.&nbsp;</p> <p>As they awaken, now scattered across a random solar system in their new universe, they begin their first quest: to reunite. However, that task is made significantly harder by the hostile alien race that controls the system in which they spawn.</p> <p>Beginning at level 1, with equipment that’s more a liability than a help, no knowledge of their new universe’s mechanics, and a Class of Worthless Scrub, can the teammates fight their way toward each other to complete their first quest? Or will it be their last?</p>";
