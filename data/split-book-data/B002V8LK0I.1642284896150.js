Because of their abilities (they can do accidental magic even while asleep), and because they are both feared and vulnerable, imagers must live separately from the rest of society.</p> <p>In this new life, Rhenn discovers that all too many of the \"truths\" he knew were nothing of the sort. Every day brings a new threat to his life. He makes a powerful enemy while righting a wrong, and he begins to learn to do magic in secret.</p> <p> <i>Imager</i> is the innovative and enchanting opening of an involving new fantasy story.</p>";
