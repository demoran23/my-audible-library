Then, after some truly surprising success as a gladiator-slave, the teenager ended up doomed to a life in the brutal mines along with a menagerie of fantastical beings possessing even worse luck than him.</p> <p>But everything changes when Victor finds a way out—or rather, <i>down</i>. With the aid of a magical portal, he soon finds himself in a fabled subterranean dungeon-labyrinth, where his wits and combat prowess are the only things keeping him alive. OK, so he’s found a companion in the strangely alluring and witty Shadeni warrior-woman Thayla as well as an amulet housing a guiding spirit named Gorz. But even they won’t be able to help him now.</p> <p>Because there are things lurking in the depths more deadly than Victor can possibly imagine. And if he ever does manage to escape the darkness, some very powerful—and vengeful—nobles will do anything to send him back underground. About six feet underground, to be precise . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
