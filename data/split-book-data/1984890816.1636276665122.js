window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>VAELIN AL SORNA RETURNS</b></p> <p><b>Anthony Ryan's debut novel&nbsp;</b><b><i>Blood Song - </i></b><b>the first book of the Raven's Shadow series - took the fantasy world by storm. Now, he continues that saga with&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Wolf's Call</i></b><b>, which begins a thrilling new story of razor-sharp action and epic adventure.</b></p> <p><i>Peace never lasts.</i></p> <p>Vaelin Al Sorna is a living legend, his name known across the Realm. It was his leadership that overthrew empires, his blade that won hard-fought battles - and his sacrifice that defeated an evil more terrifying than anything the world had ever seen. He won titles aplenty, only to cast aside his earned glory for a quiet life in the Realm's northern reaches.</p> <p>Yet whispers have come from across the sea - rumours of an army called the Steel Horde, led by a man who believes himself a god. Vaelin has no wish to fight another war, but when he learns that Sherin, the woman he lost long ago, has fallen into the Horde's grasp, he resolves to confront this powerful new threat.</p> <p>To this end, Vaelin travels to the realms of the Merchant Kings, a land ruled by honor and intrigue. There, as the drums of war thunder across kingdoms riven by conflict, Vaelin learns a terrible truth: that there are some battles that even he may not be strong enough to win.</p>";
