Following his triumphant massacre at Daskus, victory over the cultists, and rescue of the succubus Fay, he's earned a fearsome reputation and a substantial rise on the power ladder. Now he's fostering a new empire and feeling invincible—or he would be if not for an unexpected snag in his own nefarious bloodline.</p> <p>Riven's due inheritance is a high-grade planet called Lutseki, a prominent trading hub that manages transported goods throughout the Blood Moon Requiem. It's a goldmine: fifty million vampires and eleven billion enslaved, all of whom Riven and his sister, Allie, are destined to rule. But not if their distant, low-tier punk relatives have anything to say about it. Their aim is to sell off Lutseki as fast as they can to other nobles and make a fortune. Leave it to family to bring out Riven's bad side.</p> <p>Meanwhile, others from faraway planets have injected themselves into the situation as well. Worst of all, Rippenvire—another faction of bloodthirsty vampires not bound to Riven's ancestral homeland—has its sights set on the Kingdom of Dawn and the budding civilizations surrounding it.</p> <p>Things are heating up, and war is coming. But that's never stopped the Thane siblings before . . .</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 900,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
