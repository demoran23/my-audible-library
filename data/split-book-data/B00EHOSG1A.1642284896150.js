window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Taught by an international adviser to leaders of Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, and governments, this eye-opening course reveals how you can actively improve your cultural intelligence in an increasingly globalized world. </p> <p>Based on groundbreaking research, these 24 lectures address dynamics and customs related to working, socializing, dining, marriage and family - all the areas necessary to help you function with a greater level of respect and effectiveness wherever you go. You'll also encounter practical tips and crucial context for greeting, interacting with, and even managing people from other parts of the world. </p> <p>In the first half, you'll analyze 10 cultural value dimensions that researchers have identified as helpful for comparing cultures; and you'll see how these \"archetypes\" play out in day-to-day lives. In the second half, you'll look at 10 cultural clusters around the world that - when combined with your understanding of the 10 cultural dimensions - provide strategic insight into how to be more effective as you live, work, and travel in our globalized world. </p> <p>Why do people from certain cultures have little regard for time? Why might working overtime reflect poorly on you in Scandinavia? Why should you avoid using your left hand when interacting with someone from the Arab world? You'll find out the answers to these and other intriguing questions in Customs of the World. </p>";
