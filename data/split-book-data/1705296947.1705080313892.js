window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Monsters - and the champions who slay them!</b></p> <p>This is the second volume collecting all of best-selling author Larry Correia's short stories, novelettes, and novellas. Correia's novels are known for their hard-hitting, no-holds-barred action sequences, in-depth worldbuilding, and vivid characterization. Now, Correia turns to the short form to deliver stories that take no prisoner.</p> <p>\"Tokyo Raider\" pits giant robots against very big monsters in the Grimnoir universe. \"The Testimony of the Traitor Ratul\", set in the Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series, lets a man who has been called a fanatical rebel, despicable murderer, and heretical traitor tell his side of the story. And \"Reckoning Day\" gives an insider view into the day-to-day life of some of the most popular characters from the Monster Hunter International series.</p> <p>Plus, stories set in the world of both Aliens and Predator; an Agent Franks/Joe Ledger mash-up cowritten by best-selling author Jonathan Maberry; a V-Wars story; a story set in Michael Z. Williamson's Freehold series - and more.</p> <p>Finally, Tom Stranger, interdimensional insurance agent, is back in \"A Murder of Manatees\", appearing in print for the first time!</p>";
