window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A Peculiar Peril</i></b><b> is a head-spinning epic about three friends on a quest to protect the world from a threat as unknowable as it is terrifying, from the Nebula Award-winning and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Annihilation</i></b><b>, Jeff VanderMeer.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Jonathan Lambshead stands to inherit his deceased grandfather’s overstuffed mansion - a veritable cabinet of curiosities - once he and two schoolmates catalog its contents. But the three soon discover that the house is filled with far more than just oddities: It holds clues linking to an alt-Earth called Aurora, where the notorious English occultist Aleister Crowley has stormed back to life on a magic-fueled rampage across a surreal, through-the-looking-glass version of Europe replete with talking animals (and vegetables).&nbsp;</p> <p>Swept into encounters with allies more unpredictable than enemies, Jonathan pieces together his destiny as a member of a secret society devoted to keeping our world separate from Aurora. But as the ground shifts and allegiances change with every step, he and his friends sink ever deeper into a deadly pursuit of the profound evil that is also chasing after them.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b> Best Books of the Year - 2020 </b></p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux&nbsp;</b></p>";
