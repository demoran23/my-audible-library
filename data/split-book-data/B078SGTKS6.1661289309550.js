window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In </b><b><i>Semiosis</i></b><b>, debut author Sue Burke's character-driven audiobook of first contact, human survival hinges on an bizarre alliance.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Only mutual communication can forge an alliance with the planet's sentient species and prove that mammals are more than tools.&nbsp;</p> <p>Forced to land on a planet they aren't prepared for, human colonists rely on their limited resources to survive. The planet provides a lush but inexplicable landscape - trees offer edible, addictive fruit one day and poison the next, while the ruins of an alien race are found entwined in the roots of a strange plant. Conflicts between generations arise as they struggle to understand one another and grapple with an unknowable alien intellect.</p>";
