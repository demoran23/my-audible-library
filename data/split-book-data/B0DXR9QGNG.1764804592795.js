Plopped into Stonebridge, a rundown, rat-infested city, he’s given one goal: lead his city to victory against the three other mayors, their savage rival species, and impossible odds. There are no second chances here; the last city standing wins, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. With each battle, Alex edges closer to an ultimate prize selection that could change his life forever.</p> <p>Joined by Gordo, his snarky walrus-looking advisor, and an army of clever Ratfink, Alex has to build defenses, create his economy, rally troops, and form shaky alliances as he battles fierce opponents in this real time strategy game.</p> <p>But what starts as a game of conquest soon reveals hidden depths, where victory demands more than brute force. Each faction brings unique strengths to the battlefield—the Ratfink’s mastery of shipbuilding, the leopard clans’ deadly stealth, and the lumbering might of the red team’s bear warriors. Alex must outsmart his rivals by maximizing his city’s naval power and leveraging his allies' strengths, knowing that each race’s quirks and talents could mean the difference between seizing control of the map or watching his city crumble into ruin.</p>";
