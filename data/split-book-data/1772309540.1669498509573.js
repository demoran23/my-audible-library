window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The advertisement offered the ultimate Virtual Reality experience. Using a new technology known as Immersive Virtual Reality or IVR, you could truly experience the game as if you were in it. For someone who has been confined to a wheelchair all of his life, the promise was impossible to ignore, but only a few would be invited to take part in the Alpha test of the new game. Devon decided he would be one of those few.&nbsp;</p> <p>To ensure he would be chosen he took the most unlikely combination of skills specializing primarily as a craftsman and secondarily as a healer. The best race for these skill trees is a Gnome but that further weakens his ability to fight and survive. Still, it is only the Alpha test and once in he can change it when they move to Closed Beta.&nbsp;</p> <p>What could go wrong? Soon he finds out just how weak his choices seem to the developers who figure he will die a lot and always be a nobody. Name chosen, Gnobody sets out to take on Angromoria and it is everything he could hope for, until it becomes the only thing he may ever know.</p>";
