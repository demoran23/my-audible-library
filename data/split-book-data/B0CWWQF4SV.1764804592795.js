Everywhere is a battlefield and a hunting ground. Everyone is both predator and prey, slumrats on the run from bigger rats. Truth is finally one of the bigger rats, so elite that ordinary people can’t even see him. But though he may be a walking ghost, he’ll be acknowledged one way or another.</p> <p>Truth holds the power to slay the very oppressors who made him what he is. And he’s resolved to wield this power toward a righteous end. His next move: smash the System and fashion himself as a mastermind, pulling the strings of rebellion. With the help of old friends and new, it’s time for him to level up and prepare to do <i>anything</i> in the name of freedom.</p> <p>But uprisings, explosive anarchy, devastating chaos, and collateral damage are just the beginning. Because the war isn’t only being waged on the ground. The rulers of Heaven and Hell are in on it too, their ancient animosity more nuanced than anyone dares believe. And standing and fighting between them is Truth . . .</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit cyberpunk fantasy series—with more than one million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
