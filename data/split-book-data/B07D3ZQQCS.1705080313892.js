The privileged live in sky manors held aloft by a secretive magic known only as the Mysteries. Below, the earthbound poor are forced into factory work to maintain the engine of commerce. Only the wealthy can afford to learn the Mysteries, and they use their knowledge to further lock their hold on society.</p> <p>Cettie Pratt is a waif doomed to the world below, until an admiral attempts to adopt her.
