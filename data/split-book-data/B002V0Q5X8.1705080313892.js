window.bookSummaryJSON = "This audio presentation of the <i>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> is a super-duper triple issue, comprised ten key selections (most of the contents, actually) of <i>FSF</i>'s September issue and the forthcoming double October/November issue. First, beginning with the five words, \"Eventually it came to pass...\" we have \"Four Short Novels,\" a literary and performance tour de force by Joe Haldeman, which explodes Proust, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Samuel Butler. Then John Morressy plumbs even earlier classical dimensions through the eyes and voice of Daedalus in \"The Artificer's Tale.\" \"Hunter's Lake\" by Gene Wolfe is a classic horror story in which dreams and reality merge and re-emerge from the depths of tragedy. In \"The Census Taker\" Dale Bailey, takes us into a very scary southern backwater, where untold secrets lurk. \"The Navatar,\" as conceived by Jerry Oltion, is a very special AI indeed whose career, journeys and relationships are narrated by Stefan Rudnicki. Terry Bisson's \"Almost Home\" tells of three young friends in a blissful, truly American summer, taking us across the borders of discovery and past death itself. Richard Paul Russo's \"Tropical Night's at the Natatorium,\" dramatically explores issues of poverty and privilege, social responsibility and revolution. \"Like Minds\" by Robert Reed is a disturbing, impressionistic study in shifting realities which truly defies description. In \"The Only Known Jump Across Time,\" Eugene Mirabelli creates a colorful and wistfully nostalgic vision of Cambridge, Massachusetts in the 1920s. Finally, in Esther M. Friesner's \"I Killed Them In Vegas,\" Harlan Ellison gleefully portrays Kris Spiridion, an irrepressible stand-up comic with \"a little problem.\"";
