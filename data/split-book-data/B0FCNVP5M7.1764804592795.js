He's a rising threat.</b></p> <p>His recent delves into the dungeon have transformed him from a disgraced heir into a name whispered by nobles and feared by rivals. His explosive gain in power has caught the eye of every major House in Flutic—and none of them believe it was luck.</p> <p>Now Harald must navigate a maze of political seductions, shadowy threats, and veiled demands. Some Houses offer patronage. Others offer thinly veiled ultimatums. All want a piece of the secret that let him ascend.</p> <p>But Harald's not looking to sell out. He's building something of his own: A crew. A charter. A new way forward. One that just might survive the games the Houses play.</p> <p>Unless the Houses decide to kill him first.</p>";
