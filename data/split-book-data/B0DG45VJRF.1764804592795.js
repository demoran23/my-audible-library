She joins Noelictus' Hunter's Guild and swiftly works her way up the ranks, slaying zombies, skeletons, and ghouls with dedication and zeal.</p> <p>However, there is a rot within the Kingdom of Shade, and Haeight's aspirations turn into doubts as she finds a web of conspiracies in the capital, Menorome. The Hunters there are off—something is afoot. It is a bewildering, overwhelming place for new Hunters, as well as the fourth Princess of Calanfer, Seraphel du Marquin, who has arrived for her marriage, unhappy and alone.</p> <p>In Menorome, the streets shine with lights to ward off the darkness. For a Hunter, there is little rest or time. For a Princess, there is little to enjoy or look forward to. However, in the depths of despair, there is always the Singer. There is always a song. The Singer of Afiele has come to the city, same as the Princess and the Hunter, and all their fates will soon be intertwined in a greater web of secrets than any of them dreamed of.</p>";
