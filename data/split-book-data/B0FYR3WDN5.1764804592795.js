window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The aftermath of battling the Zealot advances Ruwen’s Soul to level four, adding to the tension between his magic systems. The fate of this fragile balance hinges on mastering his Chakras, and failure will result in losing them forever.</p> <p>Reuniting with old friends, Ruwen learns the basics of Chakra magic, but before making much progress, he receives a summons he can’t refuse. The Ink Lord Conclave he triggered a month earlier requires his presence, and it seems he didn’t follow tradition very closely, or at all, and now the consequences had arrived.</p> <p>Every past Ink Lord who summoned their peers for a Conclave died—usually in a very bloody way. Ruwen has every intention of breaking that streak and feels confident his hard-won abilities will keep him safe.</p> <p>It turns out the Conclave’s library is more like a dungeon—a labyrinth of shifting aisles, ancient guardians, and dangerous knowledge. More concerning is the library’s ability to suppress Ruwen’s power, something very few entities could manage, and a hint of the library’s hidden identity.</p> <p>Within the library’s twisting stacks, Ruwen finds another Ink Lord, one with a clue to the riddle Ruwen brought with him. A riddle that leads directly to the Mind and Body Towers critical for his development.</p> <p>But this Ink Lord wields the power of the Zealot—or possibly—be the Zealot in disguise.</p> <p>The answers to so many questions surround Ruwen, but if he can’t survive a dungeon-turned-library, enemies disguised as allies, or, despite the hostile environment, advance his Chakras, then those secrets become meaningless.</p> <p>Ruwen must succeed, because all the power he holds pales when compared to what lies just out of reach—the Realm of Bones. Only there will he find the power required to defeat the Zealot.</p> <p>If Ruwen fails, then all is lost—his life, the lives of his friends, and the Universe itself.</p>";
