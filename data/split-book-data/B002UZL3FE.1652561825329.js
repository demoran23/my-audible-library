window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To survive in a game with no rules at all, John Corey must invent a strategy that includes no luck at all. The hero of DeMille's No. 1 <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>Plum Island</i>, Corey has been through a lot, not the least of which was surviving three bullet wounds while serving on the NYPD. Now he signs on with the government's Anti-Terrorist Task Force in an attempt to stop an alleged Libyan terrorist known simply as \"The Lion\". </p> <p>The Lion has the instincts of a wild animal, the bloodlust of a carnivore, and the boldness and speed of a cat of prey. And now he's loose in America. Can John Corey stop him? Or has his allotment of luck just run out? Nelson DeMille spins an epic tale of heart-pounding suspense.</p>";
