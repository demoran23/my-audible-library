A dark empire rises in its place, while the old gods stir....</p> <p>After kicking an unholy amount of undead ass, Hector and his dragon have new goal: to revive the war-torn province of Myzsno, preferably before their nemesis arrives with his army and a legion of Drachan, demonic dragons that would make even H. P. Lovecraft scream in terror.&nbsp;</p> <p>If Hector is to triumph against enemies like these, he needs more than an army. He needs the Warsingers, godlike constructs built to fight and kill the Drachan. But first, he must break his girlfriend out of prison: a woman who could be the key to the Warsingers' 5,000-year old mystery.</p>";
