But when NASA recruits her to join a team of military scientists for an expedition to the Target, it's an adventure she can't refuse. </p> <p>The ship isn't vacant, as they presumed. </p> <p>A disembodied voice rumbles inside Jane's head, \"You are home\". </p> <p>Jane fights the growing doubts of her colleagues as she attempts to decipher what the alien wants from her.
