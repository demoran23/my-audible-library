window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Hurlbut's Story of the Bible</i> has its roots in the old custom of parents telling their children stories from scripture. One of those parents who kept this custom particularly alive and meaningful was Dr. Jesse Lyman Hurlbut. Like many great works of literature, the stories that make up this book were told and retold innumerable times before being set down on paper.</p>";
