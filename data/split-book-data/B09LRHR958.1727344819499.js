The newest member of this elite force is Severn Handred.</p> <p>Granted a leave of absence to pursue information about his unknown past, Severn joins a mission to an enclave well outside the boundaries of the Empire. And he will be in danger the entire time. Still, the instincts that led him to the Wolves and the sense of duty that keeps him there can’t be discarded as easily as the tabard he wears.</p> <p>While he's in the heart of the West March, enmeshed in a tangled web of mysteries that have been held for centuries, Severn's belief in justice is going to be tested. It's one mortal man and his single ally against a community of immortals who will kill to keep their secrets. But they don't know who they're up against.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>“This world feels so complex and so complete.” —</b><b><i>ReadingReality.net&nbsp;</i></b><b>on </b><b><i>The Emperor's Wolves</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Wolves of Elantra</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book 1: </b><b><i>The Emperor's Wolves</i></b></p> <p><b>Book 2: </b><b><i>Sword and Shadow</i></b></p>";
