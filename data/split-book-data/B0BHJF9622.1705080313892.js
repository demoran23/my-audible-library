But school itself is the least of their worries. As the year progresses, the nation of Valia faces new travails at the emergence of a mysterious faction targeting attuned commoners and foreigners.</p> <p>Casualties mount as Corin’s allies seek to unmask the leadership of this deadly order—and discover a threat that they cannot hope to face and emerge unscathed.</p> <p><i>The Silence of Unworthy Gods</i>&nbsp;is the fourth book in the&nbsp;Arcane Ascension&nbsp;series, a progression fantasy epic that mixes dungeon crawling and magical school content. This book also references events from the&nbsp;<i>Weapons &amp; Wielders&nbsp;s</i>eries up to Book three, a connected series that takes place several years earlier with some overlapping cast members.</p>";
