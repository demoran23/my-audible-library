window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A vacationing family becomes pawns in an ancient ritual designed to bring about the apocalypse in a riveting thriller by </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling author Jeff Wheeler.</b></p> <p><i>A prophecy has waited for five centuries to be fulfilled. That time has come. Sacrifices will be made. Let the games begin.</i></p> <p>When Jonathon Roth and his family are invited by their neighbors, the Beasleys, to join them at a luxury retreat in Cozumel, who can refuse? It’s the perfect winter getaway. Relaxing on the beach, gourmet food, sightseeing, and free accommodations. But if it sounds too good to be true, it is.</p> <p>Villa Sara de Calakmul, owned by mysterious tycoon Jacob Calakmul, is more isolated compound than private resort. Armed guards patrol the jungle perimeters. Pictures of previous guests—long disappeared—adorn the walls. And there are whispers of something coming called “the game.” Even in the sweltering heat, the Roths feel a chill—and the fear that they haven’t been invited to Villa Sara. They’ve been lured. But for what purpose? And to what end?</p> <p>From the ruins, a death cult is reborn. A prophecy to bring down Western civilization is being realized. As a legendary blood sport is engaged, the Roths themselves may need to call upon ancient powers if they’re to survive, escape, and save the world from annihilation.</p>";
