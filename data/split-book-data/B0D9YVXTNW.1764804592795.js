After a fatal accident, he was transported to a strange realm to begin again as a living low-level dungeon. But he didn't stay small for long. With a powerful will, he built his dungeon self into a force to be reckoned with, full of minions, creepy crawlies, and a hedge maze to die for.</p> <p>Except Thedeim isn't a place where delvers die.

The imminent fight against this mysterious foe will push Thedeim to the limits of his power, his mana, even his humanity. But one thing he knows is how to go beyond his limits. Even if it leads to peril. Or the afterlife . . .</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than seven million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
