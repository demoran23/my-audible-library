Whether it’s a teenage runaway or an actor kidnapped by cultists, the victim comes first.</p> <p>Money is an afterthought. That confuses a lot of clients.</p> <p>But sometimes the best way to get someone to accept the help they need is to convince them to pay for it. Other times, clients unwittingly fund their own reparations by hiring the last person who’d want to aid them in continuing their wicked ends.</p> <p>But are pure intentions enough against the vilest forces in the galaxy?</p>";
