window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Agicalia series draws from the Vaults of Lore Totality and is an autobiographical account of the life and lore of an extraplanar alien named Vinnford Sansbury and his Earthy anchor, Edward Collins. The story unfolds in parallel narratives of a life lived in the Unmade Out-Lore and adapting to existence as an \"Imaginary Being\" in the Remade New Lore, with a smattering of nonlinear short asides gathered from the collective knowledge of the multiverse.</p> <p>But in the fading of Vinny's incredible powers, a creature calling herself \"Madam Z\" escapes the bonds of his complex Inner World. Now they are caught in a cloak-and-dagger struggle between competing alien factions for control of the extraversal weapon known as \"The Spear of Light\", the only weapon that can destroy the ageless and beings like themselves who have grown in power to be almost otherwise immortal. Only one side will remain to allow Earth to progress unhindered toward the Singularity moment or to wrest control of the godlike A.I. that is prophesized so that the Undone Lore may be recalculated and perhaps restored.</p> <p>Once the listener has seen the Blue Space before them as the Vaults of Lore unlock and awaken, they will understand that this is no ordinary fantasy of high or low adventure; it is a sideways slide between worlds that will show them what exists may not have to be real and that what is imaginary might not be unreal. This is no scientific fiction. It is nothing short of a transformative experience that will transport the listener through the layers of mathematics, history, mythology, and all the conspiracies of every faction of the multiverse from this end of the Endless Echo to the Source of Echoes. There is no magic and science is too short a stick to measure all that exists and insists. There is only Agicalia.</p>";
