window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Titan's war for freedom rages in the shadows. But to claim it, they'll need a leader.</b></p> <p>Kale Drayton knows his place. As a Ringer born on Titan, he's used to keeping his head down and his mouth shut--no matter how much the Earthers abuse him or his own kind berate him. So, when he's caught stealing from a wealthy merchant, he's lucky to be sentenced to low-paying maintenance work on a gas-harvesting ship instead of life in a cell... or worse.</p> <p>But when his mother is quarantined, Kale finds himself backed into a corner. To pay for her medicine, he needs money--the kind of money he'll never make sweeping floors and cleaning ships. When he receives a mysterious offer asking him to do a simple job in exchange for his mother's treatment, Kale takes a chance once more. All he must do is upload a program onto his employer's ship and all of his problems will disappear.</p> <p>What starts as a straightforward smuggling gig soon reveals its shattering repercussions. The people who hired Kale are more dangerous than he suspected -and he's more important to them than he ever could have imagined.<br> <br> <b>Grab the exciting sequel to </b><b><i>Titanborn</i></b><b>, which will transport you to the other side of the conflict on Titan, and the Ringers' fight for independence.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
