window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mahan's ready for new adventures - just as the gaming world of Barliona thought it was about to reenter its old comfortable rut. The winds of the Dark Forest have finally died down; Altameda has recognized its new owner while Geranika is nursing new schemes of global destruction. </p> <p>Would Mahan be happy with this predictable old life? We think not! New storylines, new monsters, new dungeons, and a new status: Our High Shaman hates the daily grind! He wants a new apprentice? Then he'd better find someone who has no right to summon Spirits. A new ship? It's going to be one of a kind! A new love? Well, we'll have to see, won't we? </p>";
