window.bookSummaryJSON = "As Tolkien's <i>The Silmarillion </i> is to <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> Liam Hearn's <i>Heaven's Net Is Wide</i> is to <i>Tales of the Otori</i>. This is the back story fans have been yearning for. <p>Set before the <i>Tales</i> begin, <i>Heaven's Net </i> recounts the life of Lord Otori Shigeru, the series' spiritual warrior-godfather and the adoptive father of the <i>Tales'</i> Takeo. We learn about Shigeru's training in the ways of the warrior and feudal lord; his relationship with the Tribe of mysteriously powerful assassins; his fateful meeting with Lady Maruyama, who would become his secret lover; the battle of Yaegahara, where his father is killed; and other turning points that shaped the <i>Tales</i>. The first four volumes gave us only glimpses. Now we are treated to rich detail and more of Hearn's fantastical Japanese world.</p> <p>Gripping and bewitching, <i>Heaven's Net</i> is a new beginning and a grand finale; a story of monumental battles, supreme loyalty, triumphant love, and heartbreak. It ends just before <i>Across the Nightingale Floor</i> begins, bringing the <i>Otori</i> epic full circle.</p>";
