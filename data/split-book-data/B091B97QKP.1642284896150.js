window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An ancient secret. A legacy betrayed. A path to the stars.</b></p> <p>A 3,000-year-old secret has put Zack Lancestrom within reach of power most interstellar empires would go to war over. There’s just one problem: In order to claim it, he’ll need to leave the planet, and there are gang members, feral aliens, and security forces sent by his own father standing in his way.</p> <p>With the starports closed to him, Zack has no choice but to assemble his own crew and steal a starship. He knows where he can find one, but the path leads straight through the Boneyard, the most lawless place on the planet.&nbsp;He stands to gain a life of purpose and adventure beyond his imagination; failure will cost him his crew, his life, and doom his homeworld to a bloody civil war.</p> <p><i>The Starborn Heir</i> is the first book in Zack Lancestrom’s adventure, a swashbuckling space opera full of futuristic action,&nbsp;unsanctioned uses of advanced technology, and memorable characters. Humanity has spread across the galaxy, but they are not alone, and Zack’s quest to find a lost pre-war artifact may be the only thing standing between this universe and&nbsp;an interdimensional species that wants to blot out the light of the stars.</p> <p>From&nbsp;D.J. Bodden, best-selling author of <i>Viridian Gate Online: The Illusionist</i> and the Black Year Series, comes a brand new science fiction adventure series set in the massive and ever-expanding FiveFold Universe.</p>";
