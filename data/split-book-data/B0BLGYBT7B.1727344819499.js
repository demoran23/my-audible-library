window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Broccoli Bunch and her best buds embark on a quest to make more friends, have fun, and stand up against the forces of darkness.</b></p> <p>The crew of the airship <i>Beaver Cleaver</i> are willing to follow Broccoli Bunch wherever she may lead them—a grand gesture of love and loyalty for someone who’s only been their captain for a week. They admire her ability to resolve conflicts and forge friendships under even the most dire and dangerous of situations, as well as her courage on the battlefield against those who threaten all that is good in the world.</p> <p>On their latest adventure, Broccoli and her friends Amaryllis, Awen, and the sylph paladin Bastion must cleanse a dungeon of its Evil Roots. Weeding out the sinister plant requires our heroes to wander labyrinthine corridors, fight off vicious monsters, and keep the self-proclaimed hero cervid Emmanuel Aldelain von Chadsbourne, who insisted on joining them, from wreaking havoc with every reckless move he makes.</p> <p>But magically cleaning up a dungeon is child’s play compared to what awaits Broccoli and her companions as they fight sky pirates over a penal colony island and rally opposing armies to battle a monstrous dragonkin amphiptere. It’s all in a day’s work!</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than six million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>";
