window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Morrigan hunts the prince of demons.</b></p> <p>I am the reincarnation of a dark god. I cannot escape that now. The prince of demons come again. And I am hunted. The Fomori have a prophecy about my return, and have been so kind as to dispatch the Morrigan herself to slay me. She's even forging a special divine sword.</p> <p>Their armies of beastmen and giants march upon Hasra, and the ailing empire is in no shape to hold. They need new troops. They need us. My friends and I are being sent off to the other Catalysts we control to gain more magic so that we can resist the Fomori advance.</p> <p>First we'll journey to Calmora, to gain&nbsp;air&nbsp;from the Breath of Shu. Then we will fly to Enestius to gain&nbsp;dream&nbsp;from the Hoard of Lakshmi. If we survive, then we'll move on to the strongest Catalyst on the continent, the legendary Hammer of Reevanthara.</p> <p>Once we have secured our powers we'll return to the war, and break the Fomoriâ€¦or die trying. I will find a way to drive them from our lands, for my family. For my people. For the darkness living inside me.</p>";
