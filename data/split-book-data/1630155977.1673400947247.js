His path leads to Wyrdtide, a gaslit city hidden in mists and governed by dark demigods.</p> <p>But even with Alan dead, the world marches on. Will the government seize control of V.G.O.? Did Horace, the blind beggar, really die? And whatever happened to Jeff? Find answers, new purpose, and the machinations of the gods in this action-packed continuation of the Illusionist series.</p>";
