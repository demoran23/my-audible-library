window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A lone wolf cub struggling to survive mutates into a creature possessing unpredictable—even human—abilities in this grimdark fantasy adventure series.</b></p> <p>Somewhere in the toxic Bone Pits, where mechanical nightmares roam, an emaciated and wounded young wolf clings to life. Wracked with pain, driven by instinct, it crawls across the subterranean landscape, avoiding the unnatural horrors that dwell there and seeking sustenance while fending off rats, insects, and other vermin stalking it as prey.</p> <p>Then it encounters a deity who collects human souls and is astonished to discover a wolf, as its species has been extinct for centuries. The god spares the wolf, bestowing the wretched beast with the means to survive until it eventually acquires the power of heightened intelligence and the ability to alter its physiology, turning into a shapeshifting monstrosity.</p> <p>Part of an adventuring party scouring the tunnels, the elf Emhreeil was injured and left for dead. Blind and with broken limbs, she suffers in unbearable agony, waiting for her body to quit—or for something to devour her. When the wolf finds Emhreeil, it pounces on the opportunity to learn human speech from the pitiful being incapable of protecting herself.</p> <p>Now, Emhreeil is the wolf's de facto companion as it struggles to escape the Bone Pits, dragging her through the twisted labyrinth and fighting the vicious predators hiding in the shadows. And with every battle, the wolf evolves in self-awareness and cunning, mutating into a creature that nature never meant to breed . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>";
