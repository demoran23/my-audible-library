Still, new death-defying training is in order. Wrapped in layers of legend, the abyss is an infernal paradise of blood, depravity, and sin buried in the deepest core of the void. There's no better place for Riven to prepare, excel, and bring honor to his people. Assuming he survives the experience.</p> <p>Pitted against countless off-world enemies during the darkest trials of the Abyssal Descent—the Church of Greed hunting him through the underbelly of creation all the while—Riven will certainly be outnumbered. Even if thousands among his adversaries perish, it'll be worth it for them if it ends with one dead Riven. Proving himself has never been more paramount.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as devils, void beasts, and fallen demons gather to attend the duels in the depths, the drums of a greater war are beating above. The empire of the undead is coming. And the invading forces want nothing more than to vanquish Riven, their ultimate enemy, once and for all.</p> <p><b>The sixth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 900,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
