And now he seems to be right back at the bottom of the barrel.</p> <p>Heaved through a portal while defeating a particularly obnoxious pyromancer, Victor and his companion, Valla, find themselves on a new planet populated by serpentines, insectoids, and giants so far beyond the pair in might and experience as to be nigh invulnerable. If the warriors are to withstand this dangerous realm, they'll have to endure countless tribulations to build up their own strength.</p> <p>Once again, Victor must hack and hew his way to victory in the arena for a devious warlord, while Valla must honor an unwanted duel against a seemingly unbeatable opponent. And both will have to score more kills, collect more treasure, and face more horrors beyond their wildest imagination if they ever hope to return to Fanwath . . .</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
