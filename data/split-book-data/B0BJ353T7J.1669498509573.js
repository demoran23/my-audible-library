Defiant, the virtuous cultivator ascends.</b></p> <p>Lio Aetos is the Young Aristocrat and heir apparent to a legendary Greek sect, a prodigious talent born and bred for glory.</p> <p>Solus is a slave, a disgraced patrician from the fallen city of Rome with nothing to his name.</p> <p>They're as different as the East is from the West. Yet both of them <i>hunger</i>—to cast off the threads of Fate they’ve been given. To reach for a higher purpose.</p> <p>In this world of ruined empires and long-forgotten gods, the Young Aristocrat and the Son of Rome share an unyielding conviction. As brothers, they will face tribulations and climb the divine mountain of Olympus.</p> <p>It is a mad thing. It is utterly against the will of the Fates.</p> <p><b>It is cultivation.</b> It’s the mark that every philosopher bears plainly on their soul.</p> <p><i>Ingeniously combining xianxia and cultivation elements within the world of ancient Greece, Y.B.
