window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nominee for Nebula Award for Best Novel</b></p> <p>In this World Fantasy Award-winning novel of magic and kungfu, four siblings battle rival clans for honor and power in an Asia-inspired fantasy metropolis.</p> <p>Jade is the lifeblood of the island of Kekon. It has been mined, traded, stolen, and killed for - and for centuries, honorable Green Bone warriors like the Kaul family have used it to enhance their magical abilities and defend the island from foreign invasion.</p> <p>Now, the war is over and a new generation of Kauls vies for control of Kekon's bustling capital city. They care about nothing but protecting their own, cornering the jade market, and defending the districts under their protection. Ancient tradition has little place in this rapidly changing nation.</p> <p>When a powerful new drug emerges that lets anyone - even foreigners - wield jade, the simmering tension between the Kauls and the rival Ayt family erupts into open violence. The outcome of this clan war will determine the fate of all Green Bones - and of Kekon itself.</p> <p><b>The Green Bone Saga</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Jade City</i></li> <li><i>Jade War</i></li> <li><i>Jade Legacy</i></li> </ul>";
