They've fought through story after story and come out alive—or at least preserved the storyline enough to come back to life.</p> <p>But their biggest challenge yet lies ahead. While the vets who've been there longest want to travel to the mountain they believe to be the source of Carousel's power, Riley is more concerned about something else: the murderous man with an axe who follows their every move to ensure they play by the rules. But even knowing the secrets of Carousel can't save them from the real horrors to come . . .</p> <p>The longer they stay in Carousel, the more Riley and his friends wonder: Who's running the game? Where does it end? And why don't the vets seem to know any more than they do?</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG series—with more than three million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
