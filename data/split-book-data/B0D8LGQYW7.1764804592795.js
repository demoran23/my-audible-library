Poisoning his home, the Shadesblight cannot be ignored. The Tower of Blight will corrupt the entirety of the Shiverglades if Hal does not stop it.</p> <p>With bitter winter setting in, Hal will have to battle not only the corruption on his doorstep but the very elements themselves. As the armies of the Twelve Tribes march on Brightsong, Hal and his allies don't have the luxury of time to deal with the Tower.</p> <p>Every floor presents life-or-death battles, even as loot and new monster powers dangle like bait. But there is a silver lining. The arrival of the Tower allows for a new ally to join the Bravers, one with a penchant for creation and thievery in equal measure.</p> <p>Even with this new ally, Hal and his companions will be hard-pressed to climb to the top of the Tower and snuff out the Shadesblight before it destroys their home.</p>";
