Thomas, a disgraced knight, has found a young girl alone in a dead Norman village. An orphan of the Black Death, and an almost unnerving picture of innocence, she tells Thomas that plague is only part of a larger cataclysm - that the fallen angels under Lucifer are rising in a second war on heaven, and that the world of men has fallen behind the lines of conflict. </p> <p>Is it delirium or is it faith? She believes she has seen the angels of God. She believes the righteous dead speak to her in dreams. And now she has convinced the faithless Thomas to shepherd her across a depraved landscape to Avignon. There, she tells Thomas, she will fulfill her mission: to confront the evil that has devastated the earth and to restore to this betrayed, murderous knight the nobility and hope of salvation he long abandoned. </p> <p>As Hell unleashes its wrath, and as the true nature of the girl is revealed, Thomas will find himself on a macabre battleground of angels, demons, saints, and the risen dead - and in the midst of a desperate struggle for nothing less than the soul of man. </p> <p>Christopher Buehlman is a writer and performer from St. Petersburg, Florida.

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory. <p>But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr. Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.</p> <p>All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative, the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr. Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.</p> <p>Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that 32 hours leave readers longing for more.</p>","title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","titleShort":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell"},{"added":727,"asin":"B01GIAF0BO","authors":[{"name":"Naomi Novik","url":"B001IGNGVK"}],"blurb":"Captain William Laurence and his fearless dragon, Temeraire, have been battling Napoleon and his armies...and now the time has come to stop him for good....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61K5p3-sQJL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"12h 12m ","narrators":[{"name":"Simon Vance"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07B8TSSKN","authors":"Naomi Novik","cover":"61BOZEz6xPL","length":"17 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"Lisa Flanagan","title":"Spinning Silver"},{"asin":"B008CIILUI","authors":"Rachel Hartman","cover":"612EuXJcYdL","length":"13 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Mandy Williams, Justine Eyre","title":"Seraphina"},{"asin":"B0979GG9T2","authors":"Brandon Sanderson, Steven Michael Bohls","cover":"61zLeexuXMS","length":"13 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"MacLeod Andrews","subHeading":"A Texas Reckoners Novel","title":"Lux"},{"asin":"B079RMGL5J","authors":"Rachel Hartman","cover":"61YUHUfGXYL","length":"16 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Katharine Lee McEwan","title":"Tess of the Road"},{"asin":"B076XSGP65","authors":"Martha Wells","cover":"51Y6rqYHIyL","length":"3 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Kevin R.

The four young ones are among the last of a dying breed - the final hope for dragons' survival.

Armed with nothing save wit, claws, and a boundless determination to survive, he seeks his kind. But to find other dragons - or at least discover who's killing them off - Auron will have to search a world of mercenary elves, vicious humans, and dangers of all kinds.

As he broods on existential issues and debates with various goddesses and Alka Alon about Calidore’s fate, he must overcome his own fears and anxieties and impose order on the situation before everything goes into the chamber pot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The solution? Hire an Arcanist, a specialist in the obscure and trivial, to organize and investigate the many matters Minalan has to manage and bring them to order.</p>","title":"Arcanist: Spellmonger, Book 12","titleShort":"Arcanist"},{"added":710,"asin":"1774243326","authors":[{"name":"Terry Mancour","url":"B004QTNFOO"}],"blurb":"When Minalan the Spellmonger was exiled from his beloved mageland of Sevendor by Prince Tavard, his friend Duke Anguin made him Count Palatine of the Magelaw, a vast realm in the Alshari Wilderlands that Minalan is all too familiar with....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51ifx7vasAL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"28h 47m ","narrators":[{"name":"John Lee"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1774244934","authors":"Terry Mancour","cover":"513sp30jOdL","length":"15 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"John Lee","subHeading":"A Spellmonger Anthology","title":"The Road to Sevendor"},{"asin":"1772309427","authors":"Terry Mancour","cover":"51RTuneQcIL","length":"10 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Finty Williams","subHeading":"Spellmonger Cadet, Book 1","title":"Hawkmaiden"},{"asin":"B089X9Q2ZK","authors":"Michael J.

The Alka Alon have returned to their seclusion, dealing with their own crisis, the dead god is being quiet within the Umbra, and Min’s plans toward reestablishing a functional Duchy of Alshar are progressing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Min sees his punishment as a unique opportunity to indulge in thaumaturgical research. When the Sevendor Magic Fair brings a tide of enchanters eager for snowstone, irionite, and opportunity to his door (as well as the newly formed Arcane Knights of Nablus, the successors of the Censorate in Merwyn), Minalan uses his wealth and position to invite them to stay on in Sevendor over the winter and focus on the developing art of enchantment.</p> <p>He forms the first Bouleuterion, a conclave of enchanters dedicated to producing and researching the creation of magical items, since the fall of the Magocracy. Such notable enchanters as Lanse of Bune, Taren, and Masters Andalnam and Cormoran arrive to help Minalan and his staff of experts push the frontiers of magical science as far as he can. Even Lorcus, Tyndal, and Rondal help out. His secret mission is, of course, to fathom the complexities of the secret Snowflake of Sevendor, the enigmatic pseudo-molopor created from Minalan’s fevered subconscious...but not before they improve the lot of the peasantry by creating a wealth of labor-saving (and potentially socially revolutionary) devices.</p> <p>But enchanters and former Censors are not the only ones to arrive at the fair: Baron and Baroness Greenflower, Magelords Dunselen and Isily, come to Sevendor as well...and the results are explosive. Before they depart Minalan’s entire life is thrown into doubt. Especially when a new divinity appears to make him an offer the spellmonger just can’t refuse.</p> <p>As Minalan works through his psychological issues by obsessively focusing on his craft, he must also nimbly maneuver his way around an inevitable war between Sendaria and Sashtalia, protect his vulnerable domains, deftly negotiate his course through the tangle of feudal law and obligation in the Bontal Vales, and contend with his troubled marriage.</p> <p>His frustration, guilt, and doubt are soon revealed to be authored by a secret plot against him. The return of an old enemy and the revelation of new foes challenges his position as head of the Arcane Orders and puts his entire family in jeopardy. Could it be that Minalan’s new 11-year-old apprentice, Ruderal, is the only one capable of seeing through the deceptions in time to save them all even as he struggles with his own guilt about his role in releasing Korbal the undead Demon God from his tomb? Or will their fates lie on the whims of a former lover who has ambitions of her own for Minalan?</p>","title":"Enchanter: Spellmonger, Book 7","titleShort":"Enchanter"},{"added":705,"asin":"B07DX6Q4JH","authors":[{"name":"Terry Mancour","url":"B004QTNFOO"}],"blurb":"Despite the goblins still ready to ravage human lands, King Rard has signed a treaty with them, so Minalan is forbidden from taking advantage.

Despite the hordes of goblins still ready to ravage human lands, King Rard has signed a treaty with them, so Minalan is forbidden from taking advantage of their weakened state. Most would take a well-deserved rest over the summer…but Minalan and his household are busy repaying a favor owed to the tribal Kasari for their help in the war, and the Spellmonger pays his debts. So Minalan spends his summer sneaking 2,000 Kasari children through enemy lines, goblin territory, hostile Wilderlords, and through some of the roughest territory in the Five Duchies toward salvation.</p> <p>But the Spellmonger soon learns that not even the help of a goddess is going to be sufficient to contend with the realities of the quest. Despite his best efforts and some of the most advanced magic seen since the Magocracy, the march attracts enemies…and far too many friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>For when the desperate refugees of the war-torn Alshari Wilderlands see the well-fed legions of Kasari march by, they cannot help but follow, even if they have no idea of the destination. Any life is better than the hopeless existence they’ve lived avoiding starvation and the goblins’ stewpot. And the promise of hope the great march of the Spellmonger’s children offers is just too good to pass up. Security and the promise of a brighter future lie just on the other side of the border with the duchy of Castal.</p> <p>The problem is that the Duke of Castal, Prince Tavard, who is also Minalan's titular overlord, is dead-set against a single Alshari refugee crossing his frontier - and he’s assembled a small army to stop any from doing so. With political pressure high and the very gods maneuvering behind the scenes, it’s going to take some clever magic, some inspired legal maneuvering, and some serious effort to pull off this miracle… but that’s the kind of job the Spellmonger does in Journeymage!</p>","title":"Journeymage: The Spellmonger Series, Book 6","titleShort":"Journeymage"},{"added":704,"asin":"B08X6Q2934","authors":[{"name":"Maxime J.

Temeraire and Laurence carry with them three dragon eggs intended to help establish a covert in the colony and destined to be handed over to such second-rate, undesirable officers as have been willing to accept so remote an assignment—including one former acquaintance, Captain Rankin, whose cruelty once cost a dragon its life. </p> <p>Nor is this the greatest difficulty that confronts the exiled dragon and rider: Instead of leaving behind all the political entanglements and corruptions of the war, Laurence and Temeraire have instead sailed into a hornet’s nest of fresh complications. For the colony at New South Wales has been thrown into turmoil after the overthrow of the military governor, one William Bligh—better known as Captain Bligh, late of HMS <i>Bounty</i>. Bligh wastes no time in attempting to enlist Temeraire and Laurence to restore him to office, while the upstart masters of the colony are equally determined that the new arrivals should not upset a balance of power precariously tipped in their favor.</p>","title":"Tongues of Serpents: Temeraire, Book 6","titleShort":"Tongues of Serpents"},{"added":694,"asin":"1705211240","authors":[{"name":"Tom Larcombe","url":"B00G4C808W"}],"blurb":"Eddie Hunter is about at the end of his rope, so when he stumbles across an ad looking for people to farm in Long Term Immersion in the game Light Online, he can't believe his luck....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61e2uERN6oL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"10h 23m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"Derek Shoales"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1705211267","authors":"Tom Larcombe","cover":"61Wj4VtdIIL","length":"10 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Derek Shoales","subHeading":"Light Online, Book 2","title":"Keeper"},{"asin":"1705231527","authors":"Andrew Karevik","cover":"51vXgRo1gZL","length":"7 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Neil Hellegers","subHeading":"Accidental Champion Series, Book 1","title":"CivCEO"},{"asin":"1039404472","authors":"Macronomicon","cover":"51AUr-l9EML","length":"10 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Steve Campbell","subHeading":"Systems of the Apocalypse, Book 1","title":"Apocalypse: Generic System"},{"asin":"B099SH77S4","authors":"TheFirstDefier, JF Brink","cover":"61i1VzOV9LL","length":"24 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Pavi Proczko","subHeading":"A LitRPG Adventure","title":"Defiance of the Fall 2"},{"asin":"B09CRFXXW6","authors":"Benjamin Kerei","cover":"511kLw9liZL","length":"17 hrs and 50 mins","narrators":"Travis Baldree","title":"Oh, Great!

When Minalan gets his chance to trade some of his magic rocks for irionite, he finds himself in a position to raise hundreds more magi with the stones...making them High Magi.</p> <p>But as valuable as that bargain is for prosecuting the war with the Dead God and his sinister armies, such power comes with a hefty price. Every new High Mage Minalan raises presents potential new problems. The Magelords have inspired fear in their neighbors. The warmagi invent deadly new spells. The lower orders of magi are getting restless. The mage-led Sevendor Town wants a new charter. King Rard and the royal court are pressuring the nascent Arcane Orders politically. Some magi are crossing the Penumbra and taking stones from the goblins as well as taking their service. And some are just starting to get a little crazy.</p> <p>It makes a nice, normal little raid on his lands seem refreshing in its simplicity.</p> <p>In trying to balance the needs of the war with the needs of a well-ordered Order, Minalan finds himself making compromises, cutting deals, and bargaining what power he has in a high-stakes game where Chaos seems to be the only player who knows the rules. The temptations of his position and the power he wields are great, but so, he discovers, are the responsibilities. But when his patience seems nearly exhausted and his alliances seem ready to crumble, a massive army emerges from the shadowy realms and strikes south, forcing the High Magi to rally around the Spellmonger in defense of the kingdom.</p> <p>As the genocidal goblin army marches toward the once-prosperous cottonlands of Gilmora, Minalan and his High Magi must defend a single bridge against them at all costs. And they are ready to. But the plans of magi count little when the powerful and subtle mind of the Dead God opposes them. For when the die is cast and the first blow is struck, it becomes clear that nothing is as Minalan had foreseen. As disaster looms for the humani kingdom and even the Alka Alon are threatened, only a desperate appeal to divinity, a dangerously risky adventure and a little classy enchantment offer any hope against calamity. For the day has come when all that stands between ruin and survival is the bravery and cunning of the Spellmonger and his High Magi!</p>","title":"High Mage","titleShort":"High Mage"},{"added":688,"asin":"B00HDWNAKU","authors":[{"name":"Peter Clines","url":"B0039LGSLW"}],"blurb":"When he’s awake, George Bailey is just an ordinary man.

A gamer and a bit of a nerd, Sean's philosophy in life has been to keep his head down and get his work done: He doesn't have the time or money for anything more after his father died in an industrial accident when Sean was eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But when a failed kidnapping attempt leaves him with a gaping hole in his memory, his oldest friend dead, and his mother missing, Sean suddenly finds his whole world turned upside down as he's thrust into the hidden world of magic and the supernatural. Apparently he's now wanted, dead or alive, by all of the magical societies, though he has no idea why. About the only thing going for him is what his friend did for him just before he died and the cute track star who lives in the room next to his, who has suddenly taken a very personal interest in his problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Perfect Strangers</i>, book 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>During his junior year in college, Sean finds himself suddenly dropped into the middle of a world that he didn't even know existed. A secret world of magic and magic users, lycanthropes, goblins, and all the other things that go bump in the night. To make matters even more difficult, the very same magic users who had Sean's father killed now believe that Sean will somehow inherit his father's work when he turns 21, which is just a few days away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Needless to say most of the magic users' councils seem to be in two camps: The first camp wants him dead. The second camp wants him captured and will probably kill him after they've learned his secrets. The only solution Sean sees to any of this is to finish his father's work, the very thing that got his father killed. But in order to do that, Sean must first find out just what his father was working on! He's also going to need to learn magic himself, find a safe place to stay, raise some money, and gain a lot of allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately for Sean he's got two good women at his side: Roxy, a cheetah lycanthrope with a lot of experience in fighting; and Jolene, a tantric witch with more than a few connections in the supernatural black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>WARNING: <i>The Valens Legacy</i> contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, bad language, attempted murder, actual murder, self-defense, proactive self-defense, destruction of private property, vandalism, breaking and entering, tantric magic, polyamory, mayhem, gratuitous sex and violence, littering, breaking speed limits, a used car dealer, one Plymouth hemi, and some poor guy who just wants to earn a paycheck as a cashier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 1: The Valens Legacy, Books 1-2","titleShort":"The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 1"},{"added":636,"asin":"B08N8452GZ","authors":[{"name":"Rhett C.

Designed to combine the pursuit of arcane knowledge with the noble aspirations of chivalry, it elevated them above common warmage...in theory. The problem was they had no idea how to be a Knight Mage...because no one had ever been one before. And as a couple of half-trained rustic apprentices from the Mindens they did not feel up to the task or the high ideals of their title. </p> <p>But Master Minalan the Spellmonger decided to cure that ignorance. He arranges for Tyndal and Rondal to be tutored and trained together in their new vocation, learning the arts of magic, the craft of warfare, and the subtleties of chivalry from the finest masters in the kingdom. </p> <p>If they didn't kill each other, first. </p> <p>The two young spellmonger's apprentices from the Minden mountain domain of Boval Vale have much in common: both had their homes destroyed, they were both sent into exile by the goblin invasion, and they both serve the same master. Yet they could not be more different. </p> <p>Rondal is quiet, bookish, and introspective, dedicated to the disciplines of academic magic and anticipating a future of study, service, and, perhaps, romance. Tyndal is bold and brash: an extroverted over-achiever with dreams of glory, gold, and girls. Fate, circumstance, and the whims of the gods have forced them together, but the raw emotions of adolescence and the trauma of war put them at each others' throats with depressing frequency. Master Minalan can't have that, especially not in his fragile new domain with another baby on the way...so he sends them on the road. </p> <p>Jealousy, anxiety, passion, and frustration conspire to make them rivals - but if they don't figure out a way to learn to work together, and quickly, then their stubborn feud could end up affecting the fate of the entire war. Along the way they pick up some enemies, gain a few allies, master a few new skills, and attempt to learn the laws of love. But as they stumble through their lessons and learn to master their tempers, they discover that the strongest bonds between men are forged by the most difficult of trials. </p> <p>For after they become proficient at magic, war, and errantry, they are put to the test in the field, the most difficult of circumstances...a mission where the strength of their friendship and the quality of their honor may be what defines them best as - Knights Magi! </p>","title":"Knights Magi: The Spellmonger Series, Book 4","titleShort":"Knights Magi"},{"added":634,"asin":"B073VW3VPH","authors":[{"name":"Terry Mancour","url":"B004QTNFOO"}],"blurb":"How can Sire Minalan fight goblins, plots, poverty, and politics, all from his remote and rustic vale, while keeping the peasants in line and the Warbird of West Fleria at bay?

But now that Minalan the Spellmonger has been ennobled and enfiefed, Sire Minalan has a task cut out for him that makes defeating goblins seem like child's play: moving his very pregnant bride and a few thousand refugees from Boval Vale into the remote, sparsely peopled Domain of Sevendor. But when he arrives, he finds the land withered from neglect and filled with superstition and suspicion. A third of his domain has been conquered before he got there, and the castle he now owns hasn't been maintained in decades. As Minalan manages the challenges of being a noble, being a mage knight, being the lord of the manor, being a landlord, and fending off a belligerent (and well-armed) neighbor, he also has to learn how to be a husband, father, and a leader of the people. </p> <p>Then the fateful night his son is finally born, Minalan learns the nature of fear, as he, his family, and his very realm are forever changed when the spell he casts to save their lives transforms the land. Minalan, his apprentices Sir Tyndal and Sir Rondal, his dour but efficacious castellan Sir Cei, and his moody wife struggle through the winter and defend their domain in his attempt to prove what a Magelord can do for his people when he puts magic in their service. </p> <p>But in the distance, the threat of a renewed war with the goblins looms as they approach the Riverlands, the Gilmoran baronies that are the heart of the Duchies. The contentious High Magi convene to constitute the new Arcane Orders, while the fanatical Royal Censorate of Magic plots to defeat them, and the thousands of hedgemagi, witches, and footwizards they terrorized now see Minalan as a hero. The sinister family schemes to promote Duke Rard II to become King Rard I of the newly united Kingdom of Castalshar - over a pile of bodies, if necessary. And suddenly, out of the sky, fall dragons in the service of the Dead God to strike at the strength of the nascent Kingdom. </p> <p>How can Sire Minalan fight goblins, plots, poverty, and politics, all from his remote and rustic vale, while keeping the peasants in line and the Warbird of West Fleria at bay? With wit, courage, determination, and a healthy dose of magic. And when the new king tasks him to find a way to slay a dragon, an ordinary knight might shy away from the quest. For Sire Minalan, it's just another day on the job as a magelord! </p>","title":"Magelord: The Spellmonger Series, Book 3","titleShort":"Magelord"},{"added":633,"asin":"B071438NCM","authors":[{"name":"Craig Alanson","url":"B01AIAVB0O"}],"blurb":"While the crew of the starship Flying Dutchman have been trying to assure people that hostile aliens do not have access to Earth, the UN Expeditionary Force has been stranded....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51gzhSRr3eL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"15h 53m","narrators":[{"name":"R.C.

Thousands are fleeing for their lives as hordes of goblins pour out of Boval Vale and devastate the rugged fiefs of the Alshari Wilderlands. And the super-charged shamans of the Dead God are making defending the realm almost impossible for the outnumbered Alshari country knights. </p> <p>While the two Dukes play feudal politics to further their own ends, the only people who seem to care about the invasion are Minalan and his outlaw warmagi friends - and they're busy dodging agents of the sinister Royal Censorate of Magic. </p> <p>But if someone doesn't organize an army in northern Alshar soon, then there will be nothing to stop the armies of the divinely powerful Dead God from conquering all five Duchies in his genocidal quest for vengeance. </p> <p>But things are just not that simple: he has to cope with a sexy young Shadowmage assassin who works for a mysterious spymaster, a cocky new manservant, a dysfunctional group of suddenly-powerful warmagi, the Censor General, and a bunch of whiny nobles before the Dukes will grant him the troops and money he will need - and the Dukes have plans of their own. If Minalan the Spellmonger can't lobby the courts of Alshar and Castal to work together - and quickly - the hordes of the Dead God will sweep over the frontiers of both states. Worse, the mysterious Umbra veil he has erected around Boval Vale may come to imperil all Five Duchies. </p> <p>Minalan would rather just go home and let the Dukes handle it, but his conscience won't let him. Someone has to stop the Dead God...and that someone happens to be him. Beyond politics and plots, goblins and trolls, mercenaries and magic, the Soulless and the shamans, Censors and secret orders, for Minalan there is only the thought that his child is to be born in a world with such dangers, and that is something he cannot permit. </p> <p>It is time for the Spellmonger to pick up his mageblade, summon his allies, and go to war again...as a Warmage! </p>","title":"Warmage: Spellmonger, Book 2","titleShort":"Warmage"},{"added":631,"asin":"B06W5861HP","authors":[{"name":"Craig Alanson","url":"B01AIAVB0O"}],"blurb":"Colonel Joe Bishop made a promise, and he's going to keep it: taking the captured alien starship Flying Dutchman back out....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51hsNTW-vOL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"15h 50m","narrators":[{"name":"R.C.

But the balance of power is destroyed when four of the kingdoms violate an ancient covenant and betray the fifth: Ithrace, the Kingdom of Flames, ruled by Steveren Langene, known as \"the Firemane\" for his brilliant red hair. As war engulfs the world, Ithrace is destroyed, and the Greater Realms of Tembria are thrust into a dangerous struggle for supremacy.</p> <p>As a Free Lord, Baron Daylon Dumarch owes allegiance to no king. When an abandoned infant is found hidden in Daylon’s pavilion, he realizes that the child must be the missing heir of the slain Steveren. The boy is valuable - and vulnerable. A cunning and patient man, Daylon decides to keep the baby’s existence secret, and sends him to be raised on the Island of Coaltachin, home of the so-called Kingdom of Night, where the powerful and lethal Nocusara, the \"Hidden Warriors\", legendary assassins and spies, are trained.</p> <p>Years later, another orphan of mysterious provenance, a young man named Declan, earns his Masters rank as a weapons smith.

Lewis after his conversion, <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i> is, in a sense, a record of Lewis's own search for meaning and spiritual satisfaction that eventually led him to Christianity. <p> It is the story of John and his odyssey to an enchanting island that has created in him an intense longing, a mysterious, sweet desire. John's pursuit of this desire takes him through adventures with such people as Mr. Enlightenment, Media Halfways, Mr. Mammon, Mother Kirk, Mr. Sensible, and Mr. Humanist, and through such cities as Thrill and Eschropolis, as well as the Valley of Humiliation.</p> <p> Though the dragons and giants here are different from those in Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, Lewis's allegory performs the same function of enabling the author to say with fantasy and simplicity what would otherwise have demanded a full-length philosophy of religion. In Lewis's skillful hands this fable becomes as effective a Christian apologia as Bunyan's. </p>","title":"The Pilgrim's Regress","titleShort":"The Pilgrim's Regress"},{"added":584,"asin":"B00Q3MX9PW","authors":[{"name":"Larry Correia","url":"B002D68HL8"}],"blurb":"The Russians have Summoned a demon of epic proportions to attack the city, and all that stands in its deadly path is an untested Japanese super-robot....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51J7yd9oYlL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"1h 8m ","narrators":[{"name":"Bronson Pinchot"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07DVKDL13","authors":"Larry Correia, John Ringo","cover":"51Q-XPeZH8L","length":"10 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Oliver Wyman","title":"Monster Hunter Memoirs: Saints"},{"asin":"B00I0EODX8","authors":"Larry Correia, Mike Kupari","cover":"512CAZhT7QL","length":"21 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Bronson Pinchot","title":"Dead Six"},{"asin":"B07YL79YNK","authors":"Larry Correia","cover":"61pdh9kJM8L","length":"8 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Adam Baldwin, Larry Correia","subHeading":"The Complete Adventures of Tom Stranger","title":"#1 in Customer Service"},{"asin":"B07RKYJFG8","authors":"Kacey Ezell - editor, Larry Correia - editor","cover":"51rG1zZVa8L","length":"12 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Brian Nishii, Bronson Pinchot, Erin Mallon, and others","title":"Noir Fatale"},{"asin":"B08L8CT2WJ","authors":"Larry Correia, John Brown","cover":"5132isLIbHL","length":"18 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"Oliver Wyman","title":"Gun Runner"},{"asin":"1705296920","authors":"Larry Correia","cover":"511RqWGoO8L","length":"14 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Basil Sands","subHeading":"Target Rich Environment Series, Vol. 1","title":"Target Rich Environment"},{"asin":"B0979GG9T2","authors":"Brandon Sanderson, Steven Michael Bohls","cover":"61zLeexuXMS","length":"13 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"MacLeod Andrews","subHeading":"A Texas Reckoners Novel","title":"Lux"},{"asin":"B00H88DNRY","authors":"Larry Correia","cover":"61nlI5YALpL","length":"3 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Gabra Zackman","subHeading":"The Warlock Sagas, Volume One","title":"Instruments of War"},{"asin":"B07TLF1JRL","authors":"John G.

Tormented by questions, the army totters on the edge of mutiny, but Adjunct Tavore will not relent. One final act remains, if it is in her power, if she can hold her army together, if the shaky allegiances she has forged can survive all that is to come. A woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, Tavore Paran of House Paran means to challenge the gods - if her own troops don't kill her first. </p> <p>Awaiting Tavore and her allies are the Forkrul Assail, the final arbiters of humanity. Drawing upon an alien power terrible in its magnitude, they seek to cleanse the world, to annihilate every human, every civilization, in order to begin anew. They welcome the coming conflagration of slaughter, for it shall be of their own devising, and it pleases them to know that, in the midst of the enemies gathering against them, there shall be betrayal. </p> <p>In the realm of Kurald Galain, home to the long-lost city of Kharkanas, a mass of refugees stand upon the First Shore. Commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, they await the breaching of Lightfall and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. This is a war they cannot win, and they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas, and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon, from her eternal prison. Once freed, she will rise as a force of devastation, and against her no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying.

The city is dangerous, littered with discarded experiments from the Company - a biotech firm now derelict - and punished by the unpredictable predations of a giant bear. Rachel ekes out an existence in the shelter of a run-down sanctuary she shares with her partner, Wick, who deals his own homegrown psychoactive biotech. </p> <p>One day, Rachel finds Borne during a scavenging mission and takes him home. Borne as salvage is little more than a green lump - plant or animal? - but exudes a strange charisma. Borne reminds Rachel of the marine life from the island nation of her birth, now lost to rising seas. There is an attachment she resents: in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet, against her instincts - and definitely against Wick's wishes - Rachel keeps Borne. She cannot help herself. Borne, learning to speak, learning about the world, is fun to be with, and in a world so broken that innocence is a precious thing. For Borne makes Rachel see beauty in the desolation around her. She begins to feel a protectiveness she can ill afford. </p> <p>\"He was born, but I had borne him.\" </p> <p>But as Borne grows, he begins to threaten the balance of power in the city and to put the security of her sanctuary with Wick at risk. For the Company, it seems, may not be truly dead, and new enemies are creeping in. What Borne will lay bare to Rachel as he changes is how precarious her existence has been, and how dependent on subterfuge and secrets. In the aftermath, nothing may ever be the same. </p>","title":"Borne","titleShort":"Borne"},{"added":565,"asin":"B003AO3P5A","authors":[{"name":"Robin Hobb","url":"B000AP7LIY"}],"blurb":"With unforgettable characters, a sweeping backdrop, and passionate storytelling, this is a fantasy debut to rival that of Robert Jordan....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61-wM-ZrdGL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"17h 18m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Paul Boehmer"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"0593163389","authors":"Scott Lynch","cover":"51q+A0B7N9L","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Michael Page","subHeading":"Gentleman Bastard, Book 1","title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora"},{"asin":"B014LL6R5U","authors":"Joe Abercrombie","cover":"61Wl40L+SXL","length":"22 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Steven Pacey","title":"The Blade Itself"},{"asin":"1478916613","authors":"Joe Abercrombie","cover":"51z3MT9oomL","length":"23 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Steven Pacey","title":"The Wisdom of Crowds"},{"asin":"B002V0QK4C","authors":"Terry Goodkind","cover":"51xUwj8eKVL","length":"34 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Sam Tsoutsouvas","subHeading":"Sword of Truth, Book 1","title":"Wizard's First Rule"},{"asin":"B089X9Q2ZK","authors":"Michael J.

Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal household by his father's gruff stableman. An outcast whose existence has forced his father to abdicate his claim on the throne, Fitz is ignored by all royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin.

Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission, a mission that poses as much a threat to himself as it does for his target---for Fitz is a threat to the throne...but he may also be the key to the survival of the kingdom.</p>","title":"The Farseer: Assassin's Apprentice","titleShort":"The Farseer: Assassin's Apprentice"},{"added":564,"asin":"B01DFE6PII","authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

Korrin is determined to wrest control of the mountains back from Saradon and the goblin scourge, but the cost will be high, and the dwarves cannot prevail alone.&nbsp;Ragnar must decide where his loyalties lay; with the family he has chosen, or the kin bound to him by blood.</p> <p>The companions&nbsp;know Erendriel's edicts; the only scraps of faint hope any of them&nbsp;can cling to, but Pelenor is without allies and falls from within. Aedon only sees one choice. He&nbsp;must journey far to beseech help from an unlikely ally - one who would sooner see Aedon dead than treat with him.</p> <p>War comes for Pelenor. The Dark One of Altarea will have his dominion. Will Pelenor be the first to fall, or can Harper and her far-flung companions somehow avert catastrophe?</p> <p>Continue the thrilling epic tale of the Chronicles of Pelenor in the penultimate <i>Order of Valxiron&nbsp;</i>to discover Pelenor's fate.</p>","title":"Order of Valxiron: A Sword and Sorcery Epic Fantasy: Chronicles of Pelenor, Book Three","titleShort":"Order of Valxiron: A Sword and Sorcery Epic Fantasy"},{"added":561,"asin":"B07VPX79T8","authors":[{"name":"Meg Cowley","url":"B00M6BQ0PA"}],"blurb":"Evil returns to Pelenor.

Sha’ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of Y’Ghatan and under the fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malazan Fourteenth Army uneasy. For it was here that the Empire’s greatest champion, Dassem Ultor, was slain and a tide of Malazan blood spilled. A place of foreboding, its smell is of death. But elsewhere, agents of a far greater conflict have made their opening moves. The Crippled God has been granted a place in the pantheon; a schism threatens and sides must be chosen. Whatever each god decides, the ground rules have changed irrevocably, terrifyingly, and the first blood spilled will be in the mortal world. A world in which a host of characters, familiar and new, including Heboric Ghost Hands; the possessed Apsalar; Cutter, once a thief now a killer; the warrior Karsa Orlong; and the two ancient wanderers Icarium and Mappo, each searching for such a fate as they might fashion with their own hands, guided by their own will. If only the gods would leave them alone. But now that knives have been unsheathed, the gods are disinclined to be kind. There shall be war, war in the heavens. And the prize? Nothing less than existence itself...</p> <p>\"This novel and all others in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series follow my own pronunciations of 'Malazan' words and names.

There is peace - but it has been exacted at a terrible price: a pact made with a hidden power whose motives are at best suspect, at worst, deadly. </p> <p>To the south, the expansionist kingdom of Lether, eager to fulfill its long-prophesized renaissance as an Empire reborn, has enslved all its less-civilized neighbors with rapacious hunger. All, that is, save one - the Tiste Edur. And it must be only a matter of time before they too fall - either beneath the suffocating weight of gold, or by slaughter at the edge of a sword. Or so destiny has decreed. </p> <p>Yet as the two sides gather for a pivotal treaty neither truly wants, ancient forces are awakening. For the impending struggle between these two peoples is but a pale reflection of a far more profound, primal battle - a confrontation with the still-raw wound of an old betrayal and the craving for revenge at its seething heart. </p> <p>\"This novel and all others in the <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> series follow my own pronunciations of 'Malazan' words and names.

Now she offers compelling stories and solid theory that bring home how much the simple apology matters and what is required for healing when the hurt we've inflicted (or received) is far from simple. Listeners will learn how to craft a deeply meaningful \"I'm sorry\" and avoid apologies that only deepen the original injury. </p> <p><i>Why Won't You Apologize?</i> also addresses the compelling needs of the injured party - the one who has been hurt by someone who won't apologize, tell the truth, or feel remorse. Lerner explains what drives both the non-apologizer and the over-apologizer, as well as why the people who do the worst things are the least able to own up. She helps the injured person resist pressure to forgive too easily and challenges the popular notion that forgiveness is the only path to peace of mind. With her trademark humor and wit, Lerner offers a joyful and sanity-saving guide to setting things right. </p>","title":"Why Won't You Apologize?: Healing Big Betrayals and Everyday Hurts","titleShort":"Why Won't You Apologize?"},{"added":543,"asin":"B07WHZHT41","authors":[{"name":"Demi Harper","url":"B07XT6BYT1"}],"blurb":"What kind of god would you be?

Their technology is vastly superior to ours, and they know they cannot possibly lose the coming conflict. But they, like us, have found no answer to the destructive force of the atom, and they have no intention of facing the onslaught of our primitive nuclear arsenal or the devastation it would wreak on the planet they crave. So they have flung out an advance party in front of them, hidden within one of the countless asteroids randomly roaming the void. They do not want us, they want our planet.

It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese.&nbsp;</p> <p>For six months things went well: He found a quaint little shop, he befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and, best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins - gurvani, they call themselves - bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy - and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: to hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: there are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you'll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker's son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger.&nbsp;</p>","title":"Spellmonger: Spellmonger, Book 1","titleShort":"Spellmonger"},{"added":537,"asin":"B01DDZ3KHI","authors":[{"name":"Andrzej Sapkowski","url":"B001ICAMAW"}],"blurb":"The world is at war and the prophesied savior is nowhere to be found.

The teenage girl is powerless to refuse when this strange and unusual man with an air of the sinister directs her to perform a task with potentially scandalous consequences. He rewards her effort with a strange golden coin.</p> <p>As the days progress, Sasha carries out other acts for which she receives more coins from Kozhennikov. As summer ends, her domineering mentor directs her to move to a remote village and use her gold to enter the Institute of Special Technologies. Though she does not want to go to this unknown town or school, she also feels it’s the only place she should be. Against her mother’s wishes, Sasha leaves behind all that is familiar and begins her education.</p> <p>As she quickly discovers, the institute’s \"special technologies\" are unlike anything she has ever encountered. The books are impossible to read, the lessons obscure to the point of maddening, and the work refuses memorization. Using terror and coercion to keep the students in line, the school does not punish them for their transgressions and failures; instead, their families pay a terrible price. Yet despite her fear, Sasha undergoes changes that defy the dictates of matter and time; experiences that are nothing she has ever dreamed of...and suddenly all she could ever want.</p> <p>A complex blend of adventure, magic, science, and philosophy that probes the mysteries of existence, filtered through a distinct Russian sensibility, this astonishing work of speculative fiction - brilliantly translated by Julia Meitov Hersey - is reminiscent of modern classics such as Lev Grossman’s <i>The Magicians</i>, Max Barry’s <i>Lexicon</i>, and Katherine Arden’s <i>The Bear and the Nightingale</i>, but will transport them to a place far beyond those fantastical worlds.</p>","title":"Vita Nostra: A Novel","titleShort":"Vita Nostra"},{"added":510,"asin":"B015RJL1Z6","authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu","url":"B00456AFZA"}],"blurb":"Audible Originals bring you a brand new audiobook adaptation of J.

The young Emperox Grayland II does not have an easy task ahead. The Interdependency is in jeopardy due to the collapse of various planets in the empire. Powerful families are looking out for their own interests, even if that means killing their enemies and threatening the empire. Wheaton delivers an expressive narration using a humorous tone when needed and employing his acting talent to bring the characters to life.

Even as the group grapples with these changes, they notice that something is stirring up the native undead around the city, although the source of this strange influence is uncertain.</p> <p>One thing is clear, however. Jason might have evolved, but his enemies have adapted with him. If the Twilight Throne is to survive, the group must grow stronger, and Jason must learn to control his newfound abilities.</p> <p>Otherwise, the darkness may very well claim them all.</p>","title":"Awaken Online: Dominion","titleShort":"Awaken Online: Dominion"},{"added":485,"asin":"B07C51WW3Q","authors":[{"name":"Luke Chmilenko","url":"B01LZ2769R"}],"blurb":"Fresh off their victory over Graves and his followers, Marcus and his friends have managed to enjoy a few weeks of relative calm and peace as they continue to build Aldford.

He was trying to find an equation that explained all physical reality - a theory of everything. He failed, but others have taken up the challenge in a remarkable quest that is shedding light on unsuspected secrets of the cosmos.</p> <p>Experimental physicist and award-winning educator Dr. Don Lincoln of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory takes you on this exciting journey in <i>The Theory of Everything: The Quest to Explain All Reality</i>. Suitable for the intellectually curious at all levels and assuming no background beyond basic high-school math, these 24 half-hour lectures cover recent developments at the forefront of particle physics and cosmology, while delving into the history of the centuries-long search for this holy grail of science.</p> <p>You trace the dream of a theory of everything through Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, Feynman, Gell-Mann, Weinberg, and other great physicists, charting their progress toward an all-embracing, unifying theory. Their resulting equations are the masterpieces of physics, which Dr. Lincoln explains in fascinating and accessible detail. Studying them is like touring a museum of great works of art - works that are progressing toward an ultimate, as-yet-unfinished masterpiece.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> <b>When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","title":"The Theory of Everything: The Quest to Explain All Reality","titleShort":"The Theory of Everything: The Quest to Explain All Reality"},{"added":480,"asin":"B07DFSW9C7","authors":[{"name":"Lee Bacon","url":"B008IG2KD8"}],"blurb":"Thirteen-year-old Emily Poe has been given the opportunity of a lifetime: A chance to attend the exclusive Audyn School in Manhattan.

Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> magazine)</p> <p>From Brandon Sanderson, the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Reckoners series, <i>Words of Radiance</i>, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.</p>","title":"Skyward","titleShort":"Skyward"},{"added":471,"asin":"1980011915","authors":[{"name":"Derek Kunsken","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"Belisarius is a quantum man, an engineered Homo quantus who fled the powerful insight of dangerously addictive quantum senses.

At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst.

You, dear listener, continue at your own risk. It is not for the faint of heart - no more so than the study of dragons itself. But such study offers rewards beyond compare: to stand in a dragon's presence, even for the briefest of moments - even at the risk of one's life - is a delight that, once experienced, can never be forgotten….All the world, from Scirland to the farthest reaches of Eriga, know Isabella, Lady Trent, to be the world's preeminent dragon naturalist. She is the remarkable woman who brought the study of dragons out of the misty shadows of myth and misunderstanding into the clear light of modern science. But before she became the illustrious figure we know today, there was a bookish young woman whose passion for learning, natural history, and, yes, dragons defied the stifling conventions of her day. Here at last, in her own words, is the true story of a pioneering spirit who risked her reputation, her prospects, and her fragile flesh and bone to satisfy her scientific curiosity; of how she sought true love and happiness despite her lamentable eccentricities; and of her thrilling expedition to the perilous mountains of Vystrana, where she made the first of many historic discoveries that would change the world forever. </p> <p>\"Saturated with the joy and urgency of discovery and scientific curiosity.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (Starred Review) on <i>A Natural History of Dragons</i>)</p>","title":"A Natural History of Dragons: A Memoir by Lady Trent","titleShort":"A Natural History of Dragons"},{"added":459,"asin":"B01MFBRCHN","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan L.

When it comes to finding cheating spouses, corporate thieves, or runaway teenagers, he’s unenthusiastic, and unmatched. As a former San Francisco detective, he misses more meaningful work, but he hasn’t had the heart for it since his wife’s death five years prior. That is, until a phone call from a distraught mother, an illegal immigrant who can’t go to the police, puts him on the hunt for a missing little girl.</p> <p>By the time he reaches the mother’s small home, she’s missing, too. The circumstances are strange, but when a team of heavily armed mercenaries arrive, Delgado is convinced there is more going on than a simple kidnapping.</p> <p>Joined by his wise-cracking elderly assistant, a gun-toting pastor, and a UFO enthusiast Uber driver, Delgado follows the clues west, to Colorado City, a town cleaved in two by the 37th parallel, also known as the UFO Highway. In a town infamous for fundamentalist Mormon cult activity, they uncover evidence of a massive child-trafficking ring whose ringleaders might not be human.</p> <p>Delgado and crew are plunged into a dangerous world of corporate competition, UFO lore, and government cover-ups. While they hunt for answers, they’re pursued across the Southwest by high-tech mercs, brainwashed cults, and beings whose true identity has been concealed since 1947.</p> <p><b>...he must risk the world.</b></p> <p>UFOs and alien abductions remain some of the most hotly debated and mysterious subjects of the 21st century. In the decades since 1960, with reports of strange encounters on the rise, 13 million people have gone missing worldwide and never been found. <i>The Others</i> takes a fast-paced, unique, and moving look at the phenomenon that has fueled Jeremy Robinson’s imagination since several sightings, strange happenings, and visits with renowned UFO investigator and family friend Raymond Fowler.&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Others","titleShort":"The Others"},{"added":456,"asin":"1982595892","authors":[{"name":"J.

Try having one for a boss, or co-worker. That’s the predicament Andrea Vernon finds herself in as the heroine of Alexander C. Kane’s debut audiobook. Drowning in debt, and forced to move back into her parents’ Queens apartment, Andrea starts looking for a job. Luckily for her, she finds herself recruited—well, really kidnapped—by the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (C.U.P.), an organization that deploys superheroes. Suddenly Andrea must contend with co-workers who can shoot lightning from their fingertips, face the imminent destruction of humanity, and juggle a fledgling romance with a giant lumberjack. It’s all in a day’s work for the would-be novelist turned superstar secretary.</p> <p>Audible Hall of Fame narrator Bahni Turpin is perfectly cast as a normal person finding herself in abnormal circumstances. Turpin brings to life an entire cast of quirky characters, along with their heroically funny antics in the cubicle next door.

T. Wright offers a radical look at the apostle Paul, illuminating the humanity and remarkable achievements of this intellectual who invented Christian theology - transforming a faith and changing the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>For centuries, Paul, the apostle who \"saw the light on the Road to Damascus\" and made a miraculous conversion from zealous Pharisee persecutor to devoted follower of Christ, has been one of the church's most widely cited saints. While his influence on Christianity has been profound, N. T. Wright argues that Bible scholars and pastors have focused so much attention on Paul's letters and theology that they have too often overlooked the essence of the man's life and the extreme unlikelihood of what he achieved.&nbsp;</p> <p>To Wright, \"The problem is that Paul is central to any understanding of earliest Christianity, yet Paul was a Jew; for many generations Christians of all kinds have struggled to put this together.\" Wright contends that our knowledge of Paul and appreciation for his legacy cannot be complete without an understanding of his Jewish heritage. Giving us a thoughtful, in-depth exploration of the human and intellectual drama that shaped Paul, Wright provides greater clarity of the apostle's writings, thoughts, and ideas and helps us see them in a fresh, innovative way.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Paul</i> is a compelling modern biography that reveals the apostle's greater role in Christian history - as an inventor of new paradigms for how we understand Jesus and what he accomplished - and celebrates his stature as one of the most effective and influential intellectuals in human history.&nbsp;</p>","title":"Paul: A Biography","titleShort":"Paul"},{"added":414,"asin":"B01COOZ5C2","authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Brontë","url":"B000APWO72"}],"blurb":"Charlotte Brontë's Gothic classic is an early exploration of women's independence in the mid-19th century and the pervasive societal challenges women had to endure....","categories":null,"cover":"51UcmTBasgL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"19h 10m","narrators":[{"name":"Thandiwe Newton"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B076PPDCYD","authors":"Emily Brontë, Ann Dinsdale - introduction","cover":"514jjttxNfL","length":"12 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"Joanne Froggatt, Rachel Atkins - introduction","subHeading":"An Audible Exclusive Performance","title":"Wuthering Heights"},{"asin":"B002V085QI","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"519lrG-hG-L","length":"16 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Juliet Stevenson","title":"Emma [Naxos Edition]"},{"asin":"B002V8L5OE","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"51MSwPbrpjL","length":"8 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Juliet Stevenson","title":"Persuasion"},{"asin":"B01FN88BHC","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","title":"Anna Karenina"},{"asin":"B00K1HQVOQ","authors":"Harper Lee","cover":"51HrCuHBn+L","length":"12 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Sissy Spacek","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird"},{"asin":"B00BWYDMK8","authors":"F.

The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: She must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money. </p> <p>Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace - the world's fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it's up to Tristan to find out why. </p> <p>And so the Department of Diachronic Operations - D.O.D.O. - gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive...and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial - and treacherous - nature of the human heart. </p> <p>Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson's work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland's storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible and take you to places - and times - beyond imagining. </p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Robert Fass, James Foster, Tavia Gilbert, Arthur Morey, David Stifel, Charlie Thurston, and Kate Udall. </p>","title":"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.: A Novel","titleShort":"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O."},{"added":412,"asin":"B019P7DVPE","authors":[{"name":"Brandon Sanderson","url":"B001IGFHW6"}],"blurb":"When Calamity lit up the sky, the Epics were born.

As they slash and scheme through kingdom and village alike, the Bastard Champions uncover tantalizing clues to their ultimate quarry: the powerful Blue Fairy, who has made each of their lives a living hell. </p> <p><i>Second Hand Curses</i> adds a dash of sly wit and a heaping portion of action to the fairy tales you thought you knew. </p>","title":"Second Hand Curses","titleShort":"Second Hand Curses"},{"added":405,"asin":"B01N2PF84R","authors":[{"name":"Katherine Arden","url":"B01MF9352I"}],"blurb":"Winter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales.

Now, from one of the world's foremost researchers on stress and neurobiology, comes a fascinating series of 24 lectures that guide you through the psychological and psychosocial stress that is a central part of everyday life in Western society. </p> <p>You'll learn how the stress-response system is actually a natural survival system-giving, for example, a zebra the best chance to escape from a pursuing lion - that can change from a safety mechanism into a real problem for our physical and mental well-being.

But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source.

But in the face of brutal living conditions and the daily struggles of a new world, there is humanity and hope. Anne and Russell Jorden — two colonists who are seeking a fortune that eluded them on Earth — are expecting their firstborn child. </p> <p>The birth of Rebecca Jorden, known to her family as Newt, is a cause for celebration. But as the colony grows and expands, so, too, do the political struggles between a small detachment of Colonial Marines and the Weyland-Yutani scientists posted on Acheron. Willing to overlook their orders in order to serve the Company's interests, these scientists have another far more sinister agenda — to covertly capture a living Alien. </p> <p>The wildcatters discover a vast, decaying spaceship. The horseshoe-shaped vessel is of particular interest to Weyland-Yutani and may be the answer to their dreams.

Not only are pre-existing passions rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work, but a focus on passion over skill can be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.&nbsp;</p> <p>Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. Cal reveals that matching your job to a pre-existing passion does not matter.&nbsp;</p> <p>Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it. With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to \"be so good they can't ignore you,\" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love, and will change the way you think about careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.&nbsp;</p>","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love","titleShort":"So Good They Can't Ignore You"},{"added":366,"asin":"B01A7LE6X8","authors":[{"name":"Lawrence M.

He provides interesting and often quirky stories of the lives and deaths of thought-provoking philosophers from Socrates, who chose to die by hemlock poisoning rather than live on without the freedom to think for himself, to Peter Singer, who asks the disquieting philosophical and ethical questions that haunt our own times. </p> <p>Warburton not only makes philosophy accessible, he offers inspiration to think, argue, reason, and ask in the tradition of Socrates. <i>A Little History of Philosophy</i> presents the grand sweep of humanity's search for philosophical understanding and invites all to join in the discussion.</p>","title":"A Little History of Philosophy","titleShort":"A Little History of Philosophy"},{"added":325,"asin":"B00O1GCA5M","authors":[{"name":"Mark Forsyth","url":"B005Z05REO"}],"blurb":"In an age unhealthily obsessed with the power of substance, this is a book that highlights the importance of style....","categories":[{"name":"Education & Learning","url":"18573267011"},{"name":"Words, Language & Grammar","url":"18573336011"}],"cover":"51SvqKq8JlL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"5h 29m ","narrators":[{"name":"Don Hagen"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00J547NP2","authors":"Mark Forsyth","cover":"51k5aVoS1dL","length":"6 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Don Hagen","subHeading":"A Day's Jaunt Through the Lost Words of the English Language","title":"The Horologicon"},{"asin":"B004NEQ8P0","authors":"Joshua Foer","cover":"61EFC+wF+eL","length":"9 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Mike Chamberlain","subHeading":"The Art and Science of Remembering Everything","title":"Moonwalking with Einstein"},{"asin":"B014VE660I","authors":"Bill Bryson","cover":"51jbcJPtTfL","length":"10 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Stephen McLaughlin","title":"The Mother Tongue"},{"asin":"B07KXVVBHV","authors":"Scott Lewis","cover":"61EH3dmts4L","length":"31 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Madison Niederhauser, Oliver Hunt","subHeading":"Classic Stories from the Greek, Celtic, Norse, Japanese, Hindu, Chinese, Mesopotamian and Egyptian Mythology","title":"Mythology: Mega Collection"},{"asin":"B00IZOP8CI","authors":"Mark Forsyth","cover":"51WZ-evi+fL","length":"7 hrs and 1 min","narrators":"Don Hagen","subHeading":"A Circular Stroll Through the Hidden Connections of the English Language","title":"The Etymologicon"},{"asin":"B07HHC7NHL","authors":"Mark Forsyth","cover":"41reBFpqTKL","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","subHeading":"How, Why, Where, and When Humankind Has Gotten Merry from the Stone Age to the Present","title":"A Short History of Drunkenness"},{"asin":"1799962598","authors":"Ward Farnsworth","cover":"51ECgiXfp2L","length":"8 hrs and 51 mins","narrators":"John Lescault","subHeading":"The Farnsworth Classical English Series","title":"Farnsworth’s Classical English Metaphor"},{"asin":"1799962512","authors":"Ward Farnsworth","cover":"5124dM71tfL","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"John Lescault","subHeading":"The Farnsworth Classical English Series","title":"Farnsworth's Classical English Style"},{"asin":"B09CJDWPY7","authors":"Carl von Clausewitz","cover":"51mNAXF08EL","length":"31 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"David Timson, Lucy Scott","title":"On War"},{"asin":"B00M8U0CJ4","authors":"Steven Pinker","cover":"41u07KGQq+L","length":"12 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Arthur Morey","subHeading":"The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century","title":"The Sense of Style"},{"asin":"B09CHDTFGH","authors":"Molly McCowan, The Great Courses","cover":"51XETAhasfL","length":"5 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Professor Molly McCowan","subHeading":"How to Take Your Writing to the Next Level","title":"Effective Editing"},{"asin":"B00LU41FP4","authors":"Francis Fukuyama","cover":"51f8axdQ+LL","length":"24 hrs and 1 min","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","subHeading":"From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy","title":"Political Order and Political Decay"},{"asin":"B07LFKH5FV","authors":"Benjamin Dreyer","cover":"41J5vBo4AZL","length":"9 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"Benjamin Dreyer, Alison Fraser","subHeading":"An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style","title":"Dreyer's English"},{"asin":"B002V0K9NU","authors":"James Wood","cover":"51QSa1CvNsL","length":"5 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"James Adams","title":"How Fiction Works"},{"asin":"B07DHRMNFH","authors":"Philip Pullman","cover":"51ediplLVaL","length":"12 hrs and 53 mins","narrators":"Philip Pullman, Simon Mason","subHeading":"On Stories and Storytelling","title":"Daemon Voices"},{"asin":"1478907444","authors":"Robert McKee","cover":"511Hdt8PwLS","length":"15 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Robert McKee","subHeading":"The Art of Role and Cast Design for Page, Stage, and Screen","title":"Character"},{"asin":"B01KILD1IS","authors":"John McWhorter","cover":"51oAeMc6FsL","length":"7 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"John McWhorter","subHeading":"Why English Won't -

But Sphinx is a far more dangerous place than ultra-civilized Meyerdahl, and Stephanie's explorations come to a sudden halt when her parents lay down the law: no trips into the bush without adult supervision! </p> <p>Yet Stephanie is a young woman determined to make discoveries, and the biggest one of all awaits her: an intelligent alien species.

Galactic-sized wealth is at stake, and Stephanie and the treecats are squarely in the path of highly placed enemies determined to make sure the planet Sphinx remains entirely in human hands, even if that means the extermination of another thinking species. </p> <p>Unfortunately for those enemies, the treecats have saved Stephanie Harrington's life.

As a member of Caste Kumma, the warrior Caste, nothing else is acceptable. He is expected to take part in the deadly Trials, to journey the Wildness and protect the caravans linking Humanity's far-flung cities. Though the mission is dangerous, Rukh's hope and optimism are undaunted. Karma, however, is a fickle fiend. His caravan is destroyed by the monstrous Chimeras; twisted servants of their fearful goddess, Suwraith. While Rukh survives the attack, events force him along an uncertain path. Morality becomes a morass - especially when he encounters a mysterious warrior, Jessira Grey, a woman whose existence ought to be impossible. The holy texts warn against her kind: ghrinas, children of two Castes, abominations. They are to be executed whenever discovered, but for the first time in his life, Rukh defies duty. Jessira may be the key to his city's survival. </p>Meanwhile, a secret society seeks Ashoka's demise; foul murders cloak a deadlier purpose; and behind it all looms Suwraith.

Hamilton's superbly imagined, cunningly plotted interstellar adventures are conceived on a staggeringly epic scale and filled with fully realized human and alien characters as complex as they are engaging. No mere world builder, Hamilton creates entire universes - and he does so with irresistible flair and intelligence. <p>His previous novel, the acclaimed <i>Pandora's Star</i>, introduced the Intersolar Commonwealth, a star-spanning civilization of the 24th century. Robust, peaceful, and confident, the Commonwealth dispatched a ship to investigate the mystery of a disappearing star, only to inadvertently unleash a predatory alien species that turned on its liberators, striking hard, fast, and utterly without mercy.</p> <p>Coexistence is impossible with the technologically advanced aliens, who are genetically hardwired to exterminate all other forms of life. Twenty-three planets have already fallen to the invaders, with casualties in the hundreds of millions. And no one knows when or where the genocidal Prime will strike next.</p> <p>Nor are the Prime the only threat. For more than 100 years, a shadowy cult, the Guardians of Selfhood, has warned that an alien with mind-control abilities impossible to detect or resist - the Starflyer - has secretly infiltrated the Commonwealth. Branded as terrorists, the Guardians and their leader, Bradley Johansson, have been hunted by relentless investigator Paula Myo. But now evidence suggests that the Guardians were right all along and that the Starflyer has placed agents in vital posts throughout the Commonwealth - agents who are now sabotaging the war effort. Is the Starflyer an ally of the Prime, or has it orchestrated a fight to the death between the two species for its own advantage?</p> <p>Caught between two deadly enemies, one a brutal invader striking from without, the other a remorseless cancer killing from within, the fractious Commonwealth must unite as never before.

But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead “checking out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he’s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what’s going on.

Now, Mark Lawrence returns to the Broken Empire with the tale of a less ambitious prince. </p> <p>The Red Queen is old but the kings of the Broken Empire dread her like no other. For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister - unseen by most and unspoken of by all. </p> <p>The Red Queen's grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth - drinker, gambler, seducer of women - is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it' s all a rumor - nothing that will affect him - but he is wrong. After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: He and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war - and the Red Queen controls the board.</p>","title":"Prince of Fools: The Red Queen's War, Book 1","titleShort":"Prince of Fools"},{"added":283,"asin":"B00WNBF0RM","authors":[{"name":"Neal Stephenson","url":"B000APS8L8"}],"blurb":"A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb.

An error occurred. A mistake was made… and it wasn't Audible's fault. It was mine. Before Audible recorded the very first Honor Harrington book, narrator Allyson Johnson and I not only corresponded by e-mail but actually spoke to one another by phone. She wanted to make absolutely certain she had the correct pronunciations for names, places, star nations, etc., and I tried to make certain all of her questions were answered. And so they were. Unfortunately, at some point in the process, I replied to one of her e-mails by telling her that \"Man-ti-core-ahn\" was pronounced \"Man-tik-er-ahn.\" Exactly how this happened is more than I can say at this point, except to blushingly disclose that the original e-mail remains intact, confirming to all the world that it was, indeed, my fault. I can ascribe it only to a temporary mental hiccup on my part and crave your forgiveness. If, however, you must blame someone for the mix-up, that someone should be me and not Audible, who have done everything they could to get it right.</p>","title":"On Basilisk Station: Honor Harrington, Book 1","titleShort":"On Basilisk Station"},{"added":281,"asin":"B0077DEH7A","authors":[{"name":"Stephen King","url":"B000AQ0842"}],"blurb":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Horror","url":"18574490011"}],"cover":"51vksp09TJL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"47h 47m ","narrators":[{"name":"Grover Gardner"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B019WPM4ZM","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"41xThcH7SLL","length":"44 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"Steven Weber","title":"It"},{"asin":"B008PEX62M","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"51uf6hRTxGL","length":"17 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Ron McLarty, Stephen King","title":"Salem's Lot"},{"asin":"B002V0M190","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"511oi04Jv4L","length":"34 hrs and 24 mins","narrators":"Raul Esparza","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Under the Dome"},{"asin":"B019NNU7XE","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"61Bne-UJNHL","length":"7 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"George Guidall","subHeading":"The Gunslinger","title":"The Dark Tower I"},{"asin":"B008OLF29Q","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"51T0YJNyKqL","length":"15 hrs and 50 mins","narrators":"Campbell Scott","title":"The Shining"},{"asin":"1797122703","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"61XNutDdv-S","length":"16 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Paul Sparks","title":"Billy Summers"},{"asin":"B005UR3VFO","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"61+9wAZ0YzL","length":"30 hrs and 40 mins","narrators":"Craig Wasson","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"11-22-63"},{"asin":"1508279071","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"51--MBnUbWL","length":"18 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Santino Fontana","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Institute"},{"asin":"B0797FYNDC","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"51B4R6roT+L","length":"15 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Michael C.

The dictatorial Augurs, once thought of almost as gods, were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. </p> <p>A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience. As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought--and lost--before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. But when he discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. </p> <p>To the north an ancient enemy, long thought defeated, begins to stir. And to the west, a young man whose fate is intertwined with Davian’s wakes up in the forest, covered in blood and with no memory of who he is....</p>","title":"The Shadow of What Was Lost: The Licanius Trilogy, Book 1","titleShort":"The Shadow of What Was Lost"},{"added":275,"asin":"B00P2W8QJI","authors":[{"name":"Mitchell Hogan","url":"B00E4OMIS0"}],"blurb":"When Caldan’s parents are brutally slain, he is raised by monks and taught the arcane mysteries of sorcery....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"cover":"515LCj+AuvL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"18h 44m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"Oliver Wyman"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00P2W8LPW","authors":"Mitchell Hogan","cover":"51McwZUdfzL","length":"20 hrs and 51 mins","narrators":"Oliver Wyman","subHeading":"The Sorcery Ascendant Sequence, Book 2","title":"Blood of Innocents"},{"asin":"B08C7ZB2Y5","authors":"Mitchell Hogan","cover":"519JNWr6A7L","length":"15 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer","subHeading":"The Necromancer's Key, Book 1","title":"Incursion"},{"asin":"B078XLHCZH","authors":"Philip C.

The heart of this accessible series is a thorough examination of decision making at three key levels. First, you'll look at decisions made at the individual level, where, among the many things you'll learn is that intuition is more than just a gut instinct and, in fact, represents a powerful pattern recognition capability. Then, you'll explore decisions made at the group level, where you'll try to answer the question of whether groups are \"smarter\" and more capable of making critical decisions than individuals. And finally, you'll pull back to analyze organizational decision making, in which Professor Roberto demonstrates how some organizations have encouraged and reliably performed vigilant decision making in the face of risky scenarios. </p> <p>Whether you're the head of a Fortune 500 company, a government agency, or an everyday household, you constantly make decisions important to you and those immediately around you. These lectures offer you a toolbox of practical knowledge and skills that you can apply to various decisions - whether large or small - in your everyday life and work. Professor Roberto's lively lectures are packed with useful anecdotes, tools, and advice designed to improve your own ability to make informed decisions. As you explore the intriguing process of making a good decision, you'll strengthen your grip on individual theories of decision making and the situations that illustrate them.</p>","title":"The Art of Critical Decision Making","titleShort":"The Art of Critical Decision Making"},{"added":271,"asin":"B00546D584","authors":[{"name":"T.

They've given Nimue Alban a carefully hidden cache of technology and the capabilities of the android body in which her memories, loves, hopes, and dreams live on.

Yet it's easy to believe we're usually at a disadvantage - that others are born negotiators, while we are not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Negotiation is a skill that just about everyone can learn to do well. </p> <p>Presented by a master negotiator, these 24 lectures teach you how to approach all phases of a negotiation and deal with a wide range of problems. Professor Freeman shows you how to negotiate effectively in both competitive and collaborative situations. You learn the art of handling sharp tactics, haggling, psychological traps, and other challenges, while always being \"hard on the problem and soft on the person\" - which is the key to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. </p> <p>The course is organized around a mnemonic device, developed by Professor Freeman, that can serve in any negotiation situation. Called \"I FORESAW IT,\" this indispensable framework guides you in assembling the strongest possible case, showing you how to evaluate such factors as creative options, independent criteria, and your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Professor Freeman enriches his presentation with scores of fascinating anecdotes and case histories that vividly demonstrate what works and what doesn't when you sit down at the negotiating table.</p>","title":"The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal","titleShort":"The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal"},{"added":253,"asin":"B002VACDA2","authors":[{"name":"Pearl S.

Sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with very a special mission...and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundations of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further. And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair...and beyond. </p> <p>Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear.Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies.

Among those you'll investigate are the accounts of the creation of the world in Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> and Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>; the gods Zeus, Apollo, Demeter, Persephone, Hermes, Dionysos, and Aphrodite; the Greek heroes, Theseus and Heracles (Hercules in the Roman version); and the most famous of all classical myths, the Trojan War. </p> <p>Professor Vandiver anchors her presentation in some basics. What is a myth? Which societies use myths? What are some of the problems inherent in studying classical mythology? She also discusses the most influential 19th- and 20th-century thinking about myth's nature and function, including the psychological theories of Freud and Jung and the metaphysical approach of Joseph Campbell. You'll also consider the relationship between mythology and culture (such as the implications of the myth of Demeter, Persephone, and Hades for the Greek view of life, death, and marriage), the origins of classical mythology (including the similarities between the Theogony and Mesopotamian creation myths), and the dangers of probing for distant origins (for example, there's little evidence that a prehistoric \"mother goddess\" lies at the heart of mythology). </p> <p>Taking you from the surprising \"truths\" about the Minotaur to Ovid's impact on the works of William Shakespeare, these lectures make classical mythology fresh, absorbing, and often surprising.</p>","title":"Classical Mythology","titleShort":"Classical Mythology"},{"added":238,"asin":"B00M9AUY1Y","authors":[{"name":"R.

The greatest warrior of his day, and witness to the greatest defeat of his nation: King Janus' vision of a Greater Unified Realm drowned in the blood of brave men fighting for a cause Vaelin alone knows was forged from a lie. Sick at heart, he comes home, determined to kill no more. Named Tower Lord of the Northern Reaches by King Janus's grateful heir, he can perhaps find peace in a colder, more remote land far from the intrigues of a troubled Realm. </p> <p>But those gifted with the blood-song are never destined to live a quiet life.

The Faith has been sundered, and many have no doubt who their leader should be. The new King is weak, but his sister is strong. The blood-song is powerful, rich in warning and guidance in times of trouble, but is only a fraction of the power available to others who understand more of its mysteries. Something moves against the Realm, something that commands mighty forces, and Vaelin will find to his great regret that when faced with annihilation, even the most reluctant hand must eventually draw a sword.</p>","title":"Tower Lord: Raven's Shadow, Book 2","titleShort":"Tower Lord"},{"added":233,"asin":"B00KY666DA","authors":[{"name":"Abigail Hilton","url":"B00519ENRQ"}],"blurb":"Gerard lost his birthright in his small island kingdom when he married the court minstrel....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"61rIaR8GSrL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"32h 4m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"Abigail Hilton"},{"name":"Full Cast"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01EIEQMHS","authors":"Abigail Hilton","cover":"61fBWXSNReL","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Lauren Harris, Rish Outfield","subHeading":"Refugees, Book 1","title":"The Scarlet Albatross: A Story of Airships and Panamindorah"},{"asin":"B00LSYXX4C","authors":"Abigail Hilton","cover":"61F9jBy0+eL","length":"1 hr and 46 mins","narrators":"Abigail Hilton","subHeading":"Short Stories from Panamindorah, Volume 1","title":"Crossroads"},{"asin":"B00IO2KRPY","authors":"Abigail Hilton","cover":"61l5vGqGVSL","length":"15 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Abigail Hilton","subHeading":"Complete Trilogy","title":"The Prophet of Panamindorah"},{"asin":"B098TWVZVD","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","cover":"51UYl4VBMRL","length":"13 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Neil Gaiman, James McAvoy, Emma Corrin, and others","title":"The Sandman: Act II"},{"asin":"B099LV6Z9D","authors":"Neven Iliev","cover":"61NT7ni9SAS","length":"12 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Jeff Hays, Annie Ellicott, Justin Thomas James, and others","subHeading":"Everybody Loves Large Chests, Vol.6","title":"Mortimer"},{"asin":"1774248654","authors":"Nathan Lowell","cover":"51X5jwqfYcL","length":"12 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Tom Taylorson","subHeading":"The Wizard's Butler, Book 1","title":"The Wizard's Butler"},{"asin":"1094154350","authors":"Scott Sigler","cover":"511cs22bABL","length":"14 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Bronson Pinchot","title":"Aliens: Phalanx"},{"asin":"B07V1JPZV5","authors":"Michael J.

Despite multiple warnings and portents of dire consequences, Atticus and Leif journey to the Norse plain of Asgard, where they team up with a werewolf, a sorcerer, and an army of frost giants for an epic showdown against vicious Valkyries, angry gods, and the hammer-wielding Thunder Thug himself.</p> <p><b>Don’t miss any of Kevin Hearne’s phenomenal Iron Druid Chronicles novels:</b></p> <p><b>HOUNDED | HEXED | HAMMERED | TRICKED | TRAPPED | HUNTED | SHATTERED | STAKED</b></p>","title":"Hammered: The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 3","titleShort":"Hammered"},{"added":213,"asin":"B00HAKECQ6","authors":[{"name":"Brian Staveley","url":"B00D0GLPAK"}],"blurb":"The emperor of Annur is dead, slain by enemies unknown.

Raybould Marsh is a British secret agent in the early days of World War II, haunted by something strange he saw on a mission during the Spanish Civil War: a German woman with wires going into her head who looked at him as if she knew him. It wasn’t his imagination; the wired woman can see into the future and use her knowledge to twist the present. In fact, Marsh soon discovers that the Nazis are running missions with people who have special powers – a woman who can turn invisible, a man who can walk through walls, and the woman Marsh saw in Spain.</p><p>Marsh is called upon to stop them from aiding the Nazi expansion. He rallies a group of secret warlocks in Britain to hold an impending invasion at bay. But magic always exacts a price. Eventually, the sacrifice necessary to defeat the enemy proves as unthinkable as surrender.

In the midst of this brewing rebellion a series of brutal supernatural murders strikes at the heart of the Kingdoms. It is up to a handful of heroes to learn the truth behind these killings: </p> <p>Doctor Adoulla Makhslood, “the last real ghul hunter in the great city of Dhamsawaat,” just wants a quiet cup of tea. Three score and more years old, he has grown weary of hunting monsters and saving lives, and is more than ready to retire from his dangerous and demanding vocation. But when an old flame’s family is murdered, Adoulla is drawn back to the hunter’s path. </p> <p>Raseed bas Raseed, Adoulla’s young assistant, is a hidebound holy warrior whose prowess is matched only by his piety. But even as Raseed’s sword is tested by ghuls and manjackals, his soul is tested when he and Adoulla cross paths with the tribeswoman Zamia. </p> <p>Zamia Badawi, Protector of the Band, has been gifted with the near-mythical power of the lion-shape, but shunned by her people for daring to take up a man’s title. She lives only to avenge her father’s death. Until she learns that Adoulla and his allies also hunt her father’s killer. Until she meets Raseed. </p> <p>When they learn that the murders and the Falcon Prince’s brewing revolution are connected, the companions must race against time - and struggle against their own misgivings - to save the life of a vicious despot.

Hamilton to the classic sagas of such SF giants as Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert. But Hamilton's best-selling fiction - powered by a fearless imagination and world-class storytelling skills - has also earned him comparison to Tolstoy and Dickens. Hugely ambitious, wildly entertaining, philosophically stimulating: the novels of Peter F. Hamilton will change the way you think about science fiction. <p> Now, with <i>Pandora's Star</i>, he begins a new multi-volume adventure, one that promises to be his most mind-blowing yet. The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some 400 light-years in diameter, contains more than 600 worlds, interconnected by a web of transport \"tunnels\" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over 1,000 light-years away, a star...vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. </p> <p>Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him. Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. </p> <p>Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends. Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. </p> <p>Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery, the unleashing of which will threaten to destroy t...</p>","title":"Pandora's Star","titleShort":"Pandora's Star"},{"added":181,"asin":"B00815RHBQ","authors":[{"name":"C.

After putting more than 2,000 of his at-risk patients on a wheat-free regimen and seeing extraordinary results, cardiologist William Davis has come to the disturbing conclusion that it is not fat, not sugar, not our sedentary lifestyle that is causing America’s obesity epidemic—it is wheat. How this once-benign grain—now genetically modified almost beyond recognition and found in virtually every course of every meal—has come to have such a profound and deleterious effect on our collective well-being is one of the great untold health stories of our generation. </p> <p>In <i>Wheat Belly</i>, Dr. Davis exposes the truth about modern-day wheat, deconstructing its historical role in the human diet and the agricultural evolutions that have created a hybrid grain that has a greater impact on blood sugar levels than pure cane sugar and many of the addictive characteristics of a narcotic. He sheds light on wheat’s connection to weight gain as well as to a host of other adverse effects from diabetes to heart disease to immunologic and neurologic disorders like celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and dementia. Finally, to help listeners dependent on wheat products make the move to a wheat-free diet, he presents a clear-cut action plan packed with food and lifestyle tips, meal plans, and recipes. </p> <p>Informed by decades of clinical research and backed by case studies of men and women who have experienced life-changing transformations in their health after waving good-bye to wheat, <i>Wheat Belly</i> is an illuminating look at a familiar food as well as an affirmative life plan for regaining health and losing unwanted pounds. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","title":"Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health","titleShort":"Wheat Belly"},{"added":179,"asin":"B009KSQJ3U","authors":[{"name":"Steven Erikson","url":"B000APIXTU"}],"blurb":"The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient and implacable sorcerers....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"515+CjcswFL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"26h 3m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Ralph Lister"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B014LL6R5U","authors":"Joe Abercrombie","cover":"61Wl40L+SXL","length":"22 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Steven Pacey","title":"The Blade Itself"},{"asin":"1478916613","authors":"Joe Abercrombie","cover":"51z3MT9oomL","length":"23 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Steven Pacey","title":"The Wisdom of Crowds"},{"asin":"0593163389","authors":"Scott Lynch","cover":"51q+A0B7N9L","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Michael Page","subHeading":"Gentleman Bastard, Book 1","title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora"},{"asin":"B00A27BOFQ","authors":"Steven Erikson","cover":"61O9bJCkNUL","length":"31 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"Daniel Philpott","subHeading":"Kharkanas Trilogy, Book 1","title":"Forge of Darkness"},{"asin":"B01EXJDTQU","authors":"Ian C.

You'll be able to hear performances from acclaimed and award-winning actors, including Dion Graham, Katherine Kellgren, Robert Fass, Nick Sullivan, and the remarkable Simon Jones.\" </p> <p><b>In this exciting new \"illuminated production\", the author herself reads her own work, supported by a full cast.</b> Author Ellen Kushner is also a popular performer and National Public Radio host (<i>Sound &amp; Spirit</i>). For years, fans have been asking her to record her own audiobook of <i>Swordspoint</i>. To mark the 25th anniversary of the book's publication, Ellen teamed up with Sue Zizza of SueMedia Productions, known for her signature touches of soundscapes and sound effects, multi-voiced dramatizations, and all the techniques of \"illuminated production\". Together they have made <i>Swordspoint</i> a brand-new audio experience, in which the full supporting cast dramatizes and illuminates key scenes from Ellen's compelling narration. </p> <p>On the streets of Riverside, a man lives and dies by the sword. Even the nobles on the Hill turn to duels to settle their disputes. And in this city, the swordsman Richard St. Vier is the undisputed master, as skilled as he is ruthless – until a death by the sword is met with outrage instead of awe, and the city discovers that the line between hero and villain can be altered in the blink of an eye. Because every man lives at sword's point, if you can only find his weakness. And even the greatest swordsman in Riverside has one thing he cares for deeply. </p> <p>Hailed by critics as \"a bravura performance, a delight from start to finish\" (<i>Locus</i>), \"intelligent, humorous and dramatic\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) and \"witty, beguiling and ingenious\" (<i>Interzone</i>) , Kushner's \"Melodrama of Manners\" has become a classic, a favorite not only of Neil Gaiman but a host of distinguished colleagues, including George R. R. Martin (\"unforgettable!\"), Orson Scott Card (\"powerful\") and Gene Wolfe (\"as if Noel Coward had written a vehicle for Errol Flynn!\"). </p> <p>The artwork used for the audiobook edition of <i>Swordspoint</i> is based on the artwork and design by Thomas Canty for the original first US edition of the book.</p>","title":"Swordspoint: A Melodrama of Manners","titleShort":"Swordspoint"},{"added":176,"asin":"B005PMU12U","authors":[{"name":"Neal Stephenson","url":"B000APS8L8"}],"blurb":"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Anathem, Neal Stephenson is continually rocking the literary world with his brazen and brilliant fictional creations....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"cover":"41lp7ahvDXL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"38h 29m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"Malcolm Hillgartner"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1511328401","authors":"Neal Stephenson","cover":"41xr3JDDAQL","length":"31 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Malcolm Hillgartner","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Fall; or, Dodge in Hell"},{"asin":"B086WMZ9WR","authors":"Neal Stephenson","cover":"51WXxzSgekL","length":"42 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"William Dufris","title":"Cryptonomicon"},{"asin":"B086WNG3RK","authors":"Neal Stephenson","cover":"51LBTao9OZL","length":"32 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Oliver Wyman, Tavia Gilbert, William Dufris, and others","title":"Anathem"},{"asin":"B003VKG69K","authors":"Neal Stephenson","cover":"51atajdFqhL","length":"14 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Neal Stephenson (introduction), Kevin Pariseau, Simon Prebble","subHeading":"Book One of The Baroque Cycle","title":"Quicksilver"},{"asin":"B08G9PRS1K","authors":"Andy Weir","cover":"51b6fvQr1-L","length":"16 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Ray Porter","title":"Project Hail Mary"},{"asin":"B003PCW6OI","authors":"Neal Stephenson, J.

The alien, vampiric Kur and their avatars, the Reapers, control most of Earth - their new feeding ground.

R. Martin has earned international acclaim for his monumental cycle of epic fantasy. Now the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author delivers the fifth book in his spellbinding landmark series - as both familiar faces and surprising new forces vie for a foothold in a fragmented empire.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance once again - beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has three times 3,000 enemies, and many have set out to find her. Yet, as they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.&nbsp;</p> <p>To the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone - a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, will face his greatest challenge yet. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.&nbsp;</p> <p>And from all corners, bitter conflicts soon reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</p>","title":"A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5","titleShort":"A Dance with Dragons"},{"added":164,"asin":"B004QISZN6","authors":[{"name":"Patrick Rothfuss","url":"B001DAHXZQ"}],"blurb":"My name is Kvothe.

Following his return to America after 20 years in Britain, Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The AT, as it's affectionately known to thousands of hikers, offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes - and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to test his own powers of ineptitude, and to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings. But <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this fragile and beautiful trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, a lament, and a celebration, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is destined to become a modern classic of travel literature.","title":"A Walk in the Woods","titleShort":"A Walk in the Woods"},{"added":162,"asin":"B0030MTMLS","authors":[{"name":"Alastair Reynolds","url":"B000APTREU"}],"blurb":"The once-utopian Chasm City - a domed human settlement on an otherwise inhospitable planet - has been overrun by a virus known as the Melding Plague....","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"cover":"41cvGfqhaiL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"23h 3m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"John Lee"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1O58E","authors":"Alastair Reynolds","cover":"51b8vS5ettL","length":"27 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"John Lee","title":"Redemption Ark"},{"asin":"B002V8LCH4","authors":"Alastair Reynolds","cover":"512fnmH+ctL","length":"18 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"John Lee","title":"House of Suns"},{"asin":"B004ZLBCO8","authors":"Iain M.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure.

In his revolutionary best seller, <i>The Long Tail</i>, Chris Anderson demonstrated how the online marketplace creates niche markets, allowing products and consumers to connect in a way that has never been possible before. Now, in <i>Free</i>, he makes the compelling case that, in many instances, businesses can profit more from giving things away than they can by charging for them. <p>Far more than a promotional gimmick, Free is a business strategy that may well be essential to a company's survival. The costs associated with the growing online economy are trending toward zero at an incredible rate. Never in the course of human history have the primary inputs to an industrial economy fallen in price so fast and for so long.</p> <p>Just think that in 1961 a single transistor cost $10; now Intel's latest chip has two billion transistors and sells for $300 (or 0.000015 cents per transistor - effectively too cheap to price). The traditional economics of scarcity just don't apply to bandwidth, processing power, and hard-drive storage. Yet this is just one engine behind the new Free, a reality that goes beyond a marketing gimmick or a cross-subsidy. </p> <p>Anderson also points to the growth of the reputation economy; explains different models for unleashing the power of Free; and shows how to compete when your competitors are giving away what you're trying to sell.</p> <p>In <i>Free</i>, Chris Anderson explores this radical idea for the new global economy and demonstrates how this revolutionary price can be harnessed for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike.</p>","title":"FREE: The Future of a Radical Price","titleShort":"FREE: The Future of a Radical Price"},{"added":113,"asin":"B002V5CMK8","authors":[{"name":"Jim Butcher","url":"B001H6U718"}],"blurb":"For millennia, the people of Alera have used their unique bond with the elementals for protection.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible.

Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.

It is a dramatic chronicle of 1,000 years of political, social, and economic transformation beginning with the dissolution of the classical Mediterranean civilization and ending with the first flowering of the Renaissance. It is also the story of two new religions, Christianity and Islam, both of which were destined to dominate the mind of every person in those new civilizations arising in their wake. This was the great Age of Faith, a time of darkness and a time of enlightenment...a time of lords and vassals, popes and kings, and commerce and cathedrals. <p>This great history starts with a survey of Christianity, then continues with an exploration of the \"dark ages\" following the fall of Rome, before proceeding with an explanation of how Europe coped with, and absorbed, the barbarians who overran the Empire. It goes on to trace the development of feudalism and Islam, and describes the harrowing survival of Byzantium throughout the brutal chaos that swirled about the Eastern Roman Empire during the 9th and 10th centuries. Discover how national monarchies and the modern nation state came into being, how the West responded to the Islamic invasions, and how Christianity penetrated into the farthest reaches of Northern Europe. Understand the dramatic repercussions of the Great Schism in Christianity and how economic change in the West almost destroyed the church. Finally, discover the events which gave rise to the magnificent flowering of the Gothic Age and the explosion of knowledge which subsequently paved the way for the Renaissance. The Middle Ages were the precursor to everything which we in the west consider \"modern.\" This beautifully written history tells you why.</p>","title":"A History of the Middle Ages","titleShort":"A History of the Middle Ages"},{"added":97,"asin":"B002VA9EXQ","authors":[{"name":"Stephen R.

They thrive on the scent of fear. And if it is night, as sure as darkness, they will come. <p>On this pitiless world, the indomitable spirit of mankind still breathes in Lieutenant David Valentine. Brought into the Wolves - an elite guerilla force sworn to win back Earth - Valentine leads his first command in the Kurian Zone. Driven by the losses of his past and the hope of a future, Valentine is in it to win. No matter how long it takes. No matter what doom awaits him beyond his wildest nightmares.</p> <p>Bonus Audio: Includes an exclusive introduction by author E.E.

He dotes on his four children and hides from them the dark realities of traffic in drugs and human lives on which their prosperity depends.<p>Leodan hopes that he might change this, but powerful forces stand in his way. A deadly assassin sent from a race called the Mein, exiled long ago to an ice-locked stronghold in the frozen north, strikes at Leodan in the heart of Acacia while the Mein also unleash surprise attacks across the empire. On his deathbed, Leodan puts into play a plan to allow his children to escape, each to his separate destiny.

Her newfound freedom is costly, bittersweet with memories, regrets, and guilty secrets, for she knows the truth of what brought her land to the brink of destruction. And now the road, escape, beckons...A simple pilgrimage, perhaps. Quite fitting for the Dowager Royina of Chalion. <p>Yet something else is free, too, something beyond deadly. To the north lies the vital border fortress of Porifors. Memories linger there as well, of wars and invasions and the mighty Golden General of Jokona. And someone, something, watches from across that border: humans, demons, gods.</p> <p>Ista thinks her little party of pilgrims wanders at will, but whose? When Ista's retinue is unexpectedly set upon not long into its travels, a mysterious ally appears, a warrior nobleman who fights like a berserker. The temporary safety of her enigmatic champion's castle cannot ease Ista's mounting dread, however, when she finds his dark secrets are entangled with hers in a net of the gods' own weaving.</p> <p>In her dreams, the threads are already drawing her to unforseen chances, fateful meetings, fearsome choices. What the inscrutable gods commanded of her in the past brought her land to the brink of devastation. Now, once again, they have chosen Ista as their instrument. And again, for good or for ill, she must comply.</p>","title":"Paladin of Souls","titleShort":"Paladin of Souls"},{"added":74,"asin":"B002V1OF70","authors":[{"name":"Frank Herbert","url":"B000APO5OM"}],"blurb":"Set on a desert planet, Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious Maud'dib, avenge a plot against his family, and bring to fruition humankind's most ancient dream....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51f3UPrSPSL","downloaded":true,"favorite":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"21h 2m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Scott Brick"},{"name":"Orlagh Cassidy"},{"name":"Euan Morton"},{"name":"Simon Vance"},{"name":"Ilyana Kadushin"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B003D8W5VS","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"51ijH6jrqAL","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Foundation (Apple Series Tie-in Edition)"},{"asin":"B08G9PRS1K","authors":"Andy Weir","cover":"51b6fvQr1-L","length":"16 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Ray Porter","title":"Project Hail Mary"},{"asin":"B098TWVZVD","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","cover":"51UYl4VBMRL","length":"13 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Neil Gaiman, James McAvoy, Emma Corrin, and others","title":"The Sandman: Act II"},{"asin":"B002VA9SWS","authors":"Douglas Adams","cover":"51b09NRSkiL","length":"5 hrs and 51 mins","narrators":"Stephen Fry","title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"},{"asin":"B002UZZ93G","authors":"George R.R.

The Prime Minister himself has placed Nathaniel in charge of capturing the Resistance, a group of unruly commoners working to undermine the magicians' empire. But after several failed attempts, Nathaniel is forced to admit he can't do it alone. With his career on the line, he reluctantly summons his only hope for success, the 5,000-year-old wise-cracking djinni Bartimaeus. <p>The duo is reunited just in time: the Resistance is growing more audacious than ever. And to make matters worse, a seemingly invulnerable clay golem is wreaking destruction throughout London, sending the entire city into pandemonium.

It is concerned with the lives of several ordinary people, albeit ones with high social standing. The novel explores the very fabric of Victorian society in the 1800s, showing how various human passions, heroism, egotism, love, and lust, interrelate within this society. <p>The novel is set in the small town of Middlemarch and follows the inter-related lives of several characters. At the heart of the book is Dorothea, a kind-hearted and honest woman, who longs to find some way to improve the world. She marries an older academic, Casaubon, against the advice of her friends and family. Casaubon tries to assert his influence over Dorothea, but she refuses to succumb to Casaubon's will. Casaubon soon dies of a heart attack, and Dorothea marries his cousin, Will. But, in a last attempt to control Dorothea's life, Casaubon's will states that if Dorothea marries Will, she will lose her claim to Casaubon's estate.</p> <p>Other unforgettable characters in <i>Middlemarch</i> include the young doctor, Lydgate, who come to the town to start his own practice.

Then John Morressy plumbs even earlier classical dimensions through the eyes and voice of Daedalus in \"The Artificer's Tale.\" \"Hunter's Lake\" by Gene Wolfe is a classic horror story in which dreams and reality merge and re-emerge from the depths of tragedy. In \"The Census Taker\" Dale Bailey, takes us into a very scary southern backwater, where untold secrets lurk. \"The Navatar,\" as conceived by Jerry Oltion, is a very special AI indeed whose career, journeys and relationships are narrated by Stefan Rudnicki. Terry Bisson's \"Almost Home\" tells of three young friends in a blissful, truly American summer, taking us across the borders of discovery and past death itself. Richard Paul Russo's \"Tropical Night's at the Natatorium,\" dramatically explores issues of poverty and privilege, social responsibility and revolution. \"Like Minds\" by Robert Reed is a disturbing, impressionistic study in shifting realities which truly defies description. In \"The Only Known Jump Across Time,\" Eugene Mirabelli creates a colorful and wistfully nostalgic vision of Cambridge, Massachusetts in the 1920s. Finally, in Esther M.

Reviving a thousand-year tradition of chivalry, honor, and heroism, <i>The Compleat Gentleman</i> provides the essential model for 21st-century masculinity. <p> Despite our confusion, real manhood is not complicated. It is an ancient ideal based on service to one's God, country, family, and friends, a simple but arduous ideal worthy of a lifetime of struggle.</p> <p> Miner's gentleman stands out for his dignity, restraint, and discernment. He rejects the notion that one way of behaving is as good as another. He belongs to an aristocracy of virtue, not of wealth or birth. Proposing neither a club nor a movement, Miner describes a lofty code of manly conduct, which, far from threatening democracy, is necessary for its survival.</p> <p> Miner traces the concept of manliness from the jousting fields of the 12th century to the decks of the Titanic. The three masculine archetypes that emerge, the warrior, the lover, and the monk, combine in the character of the \"compleat gentleman\".

The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor\", and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of: a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history. <p>The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known, and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself, to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive.</p> <p>What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed, and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign, and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.</p>","title":"The Historian","titleShort":"The Historian"},{"added":41,"asin":"B002V0KCTQ","authors":[{"name":"Vince Flynn","url":"B000APHM1K"}],"blurb":"In the tangled, duplicitous world of espionage, there are those, even among America's allies, who want to see Mitch Rapp eliminated.

But armed with his genetically engineered instincts, and his trusty twin Kalashnikovs, Takeshi is ready to take on anything...and let the devil take whoever's left behind. </p>","title":"Broken Angels","titleShort":"Broken Angels"},{"added":31,"asin":"B0036KOGV0","authors":[{"name":"Jasper Fforde","url":"B000APXZAC"}],"blurb":"Fresh from The Eyre Affair, literary sleuth Thursday Next is back on another wildly imaginative journey through time and literature.","cover":"5194DU9ilwL","length":"11h 23m","narrators":[{"name":"Elizabeth Sastre"}],"progress":0,"storePageMissing":true,"title":"Lost in a Good Book: A Thursday Next Novel"},{"added":30,"asin":"B002V8LBCA","authors":[{"name":"Orson Scott Card","url":"B000AQ3SS0"}],"blurb":"Bean, once the smallest student at the Battle School, and Ender Wiggin's right hand, has grown to be a power on Earth....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51wsBl+XmAL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"12h 26m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"David Birney"},{"name":"Scott Brick"},{"name":"Full Cast"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B006L7BE8S","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"61JGl1DiZ6L","length":"6 hrs and 23 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki, Emily Janice Card, Scott Brick, and others","title":"Shadows in Flight"},{"asin":"B074PXFZFX","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"51xBs7jHfwL","length":"11 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","title":"Children of the Fleet"},{"asin":"B002V080V8","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"51fDyFwesnL","length":"11 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","title":"Empire: The Empire Duet, Part 1"},{"asin":"B08G9PRS1K","authors":"Andy Weir","cover":"51b6fvQr1-L","length":"16 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Ray Porter","title":"Project Hail Mary"},{"asin":"B004CF04VE","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"516EGGj6-EL","length":"17 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki, Kirby Heyborne, Don Leslie, and others","subHeading":"Book 1","title":"Pathfinder"},{"asin":"B002V5H4RO","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"61wKFiTTUAL","length":"13 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick, Christopher Cazenove, Gabrielle de Cuir, and others","subHeading":"The Redemption of Christopher Columbus","title":"Pastwatch"},{"asin":"B004HC9VOS","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"514ekugYAxL","length":"12 hrs and 21 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki, Emily Janice Card","subHeading":"Mithermages, Book 1","title":"The Lost Gate"},{"asin":"1799903079","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"41l3-IThHYL","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","subHeading":"A Micropowers Novel","title":"Duplex"},{"asin":"B002V01FUG","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"51Trg-nOd6L","length":"9 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick, Gabrielle de Cuir, Stephen Hoye","subHeading":"Tales of Alvin Maker, Book 1","title":"Seventh Son"},{"asin":"B002V00Z16","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"61YGQtTtpRL","length":"10 hrs and 33 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","subHeading":"Homecoming, Volume 1","title":"The Memory of Earth"},{"asin":"B0036GIMKA","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"51H-+7opTwL","length":"7 hrs and 53 mins","narrators":"David Birney, Scott Brick, Don Leslie","subHeading":"Tales of Dread: Book One of Maps in a Mirror","title":"The Hanged Man"},{"asin":"B002VA99ZE","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"51j9VBHsgoL","length":"18 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"The Worthing Saga"},{"asin":"B0036NDGU4","authors":"Orson Scott Card","cover":"61NNNq3lv+L","length":"17 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","title":"Enchantment"},{"asin":"B003D8W5VS","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"51ijH6jrqAL","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Foundation (Apple Series Tie-in Edition)"},{"asin":"0593396960","authors":"Ernest Cline","cover":"516MN+bKViL","length":"13 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Ready Player Two"},{"asin":"B072R1CY4P","authors":"Andy Weir","cover":"51fisVXQNrL","length":"8 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Rosario Dawson","title":"Artemis"},{"asin":"1705009050","authors":"J.

He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Earth was at war - a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth - they had time to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. That story is told in two books, Orson Scott Card's beloved classic <i>Ender's Game</i>, and its parallel, <i>Ender's Shadow</i>. Now, in <i>Shadow of the Giant</i>, Bean's story continues.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he became Ender Wiggins' right hand. Since then he has grown to be a power on Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender's defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he has never known - but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his enemies - old enemies from the days in Ender's Jeesh, new enemies from the wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in Ender's footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the Hegemon, and look to the stars.&nbsp;</p>","title":"Shadow of the Giant","titleShort":"Shadow of the Giant"},{"added":29,"asin":"B002UZKVQQ","authors":[{"name":"Wilkie Collins","url":"B000APVLTY"}],"blurb":"No, the \"Moonstone\" isn't a celestial relic, it's a gigantic yellow diamond of unearthly beauty...","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"51FjN1ScneL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"20h 28m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"Patrick Tull"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002ZFX1PY","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51fQFJ1h0fL","length":"25 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Roger Rees, Rosalyn Landor, John Lee, and others","title":"The Woman in White"},{"asin":"1781982740","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51kFM+XXIzL","length":"27 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Nicholas Boulton, Rachel Atkins, Russell Bentley, and others","title":"No Name"},{"asin":"1781983739","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51RNrxrzT6S","length":"23 hrs","narrators":"Nicolas Boulton","title":"Man and Wife"},{"asin":"1781983577","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51e4p2Du6pL","length":"13 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Nicholas Boulton","title":"The Dead Secret"},{"asin":"1781982627","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51QE-hgK87L","length":"30 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"Nicholas Boulton, Rachel Atkins, David Rintoul, and others","title":"Armadale"},{"asin":"1529142458","authors":"Wilkie Collins","cover":"51TQzE5AmNL","length":"24 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Harry Lloyd, John Sharp, full cast, and others","subHeading":"Dramatisations and Readings of His Sensational Stories Including The Woman in White & The Moonstone","title":"The Wilkie Collins BBC Radio Collection"},{"asin":"B002V5CW08","authors":"Daniel Defoe","cover":"51qBBzZYbVL","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Robinson Crusoe"},{"asin":"B074WFWVRZ","authors":"Yann Martel","cover":"51ZGAKat54L","length":"12 hrs and 53 mins","narrators":"Vikas Adam","title":"Life of Pi"},{"asin":"B002V1LT0G","authors":"Craig Johnson","cover":"51Mhxf2RiUL","length":"13 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"George Guidall","subHeading":"A Walt Longmire Mystery","title":"The Cold Dish"},{"asin":"B00QL82G3E","authors":"Raymond Chandler","cover":"61csWeMBgJL","length":"6 hrs and 16 mins","narrators":"Ray Porter","title":"The Big Sleep"},{"asin":"1665019557","authors":"Anthony Trollope","cover":"51BBUP-JlcL","length":"22 hrs and 5 mins","narrators":"Nigel Patterson","title":"Is He Popenjoy?"},{"asin":"B06WLMWF2S","authors":"Arthur Conan Doyle, Stephen Fry - introductions","cover":"51T1NWIkR4L","length":"62 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Stephen Fry","title":"Sherlock Holmes"},{"asin":"B003F7NZS4","authors":"Henry James","cover":"51Y63dPOLkL","length":"23 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"John Wood","title":"The Portrait of a Lady"},{"asin":"B079LMW8P3","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"51JXnb3uS1L","length":"43 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Miriam Margolyes","subHeading":"The Audible Dickens Collection","title":"Bleak House"},{"asin":"B002V5GW90","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"51zB5aAv8eL","length":"31 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Our Mutual Friend"},{"asin":"1250772958","authors":"Robert Traver","cover":"51hxKROExBL","length":"19 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Jason Culp","title":"Anatomy of a Murder"},{"asin":"B002V5H6BS","authors":"Diana Gabaldon","cover":"51EbNHun0bL","length":"9 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Jeff Woodman","title":"Lord John and the Private Matter"},{"asin":"B00J47K6XG","authors":"Jodi Taylor","cover":"61yQjlFNP4L","length":"9 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Zara Ramm","subHeading":"The Chronicles of St Mary's, Book 1","title":"Just One Damned Thing After Another"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"rating":4,"ratings":811,"releaseDate":"2001-12-30","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/000164/bk_reco_000164_sample.mp3","series":null,"summary":"<p>No, the \"Moonstone\" isn't a celestial relic, it's a gigantic yellow diamond of unearthly beauty that was given to Rachel Verinder as a present on her 18th birthday - and stolen that very night!

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?&nbsp;</p> <p>But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long.

Eugene Peterson, translator and editor, learned from his years of teaching and pastoring that most people, through familiarity or frustration with the Bible, were missing the whole message of Scripture: the Word that God uses to create and save us, heal and bless us, judge and rule over us.
